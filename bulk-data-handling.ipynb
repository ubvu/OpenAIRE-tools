    "# OpenAIRE Community Data Dump Handling: Extraction, Tranformation and Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will start with one of the [OpenAIRE Community Subgraphs](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/downloads/subgraphs) to enrich that informatino for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data process will extract an [OpenAIRE community data dump from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3974604), transforms it in to a portable file format .parquet (and updatable with changes for time seires analysis), that can be used to query with DuckDB, to enrich this with additional data  (also in .parquet, for join queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "This additional data can be societal impact data from [Altmetric.com](https://details-page-api-docs.altmetric.com/) or [Overton.io](https://app.overton.io/swagger.php), Gender data using [genderize.io](https://genderize.io/documentation), sdg classification using [aurora-sdg](https://aurora-universities.eu/sdg-research/sdg-api/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This script needs to be written in a way so that it can run every month using  the latest data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* the folder ./data/ is put in .gitignore to prevent that bulk datais sent to a code repository. So make sure that folder exists, and mkdir if not exists. \n",
    "* The script downloads the lastest Data Dump Tar file from one selected community. See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3974604 for the latest list. In our case the Aurora tar file. https://zenodo.org/records/14887484/files/aurora.tar?download=1\n",
    "  * Use the json record of zenodo to get to the latest record, and fetch the download link of the aurora.tar file. for example : https://zenodo.org/records/14887484/export/json or https://zenodo.org/api/records/14887484/versions/latest \n",
    "  Make the tar filename a variable, so it can be used for multiple community dumps.\n",
    "  Download the tar file in a target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/ where a subfolder is created using the filename and the timestamp. Make this also as a  variable to use later on.\n",
    "* Extract the tar file, to the compressed .json.gz files and put these in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/01-extracted/\n",
    "* Transform the compressed .json.gz files into a single .parquet file in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/02-transformed/\n",
    "Use instructions in sections \"Processing JSON files with DuckDB\" and \"Full dataset, bit by bit\" and \"Splitting and Processing JSON Files in Batches\" https://github.com/mosart/OpenAIRE-tools/blob/main/duckdb-querying.ipynb to start with. (be aware of error messages, and fix the issues to get all the data in)\n",
    "* Extract the SQL schema (schema-datadump.sql) from the .parquet file and put it in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/02-transformed/ This is needed for further processing of the records with DuckDB later on.\n",
    "Use instructions in section \"Extracting Schema from Parquet File\" https://github.com/mosart/OpenAIRE-tools/blob/main/duckdb-querying.ipynb to start with.\n",
    "* Query to get all identifiers: openaire id, doi, isbn, hdl, etc.\n",
    "* **Get Altmetric data:**\n",
    "* Extract the Altmetric data using the Identifiers. put that in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/03-altmetric-extracted/\n",
    "* Transform the Altmetric data to a single .parquet file, with the identifiers. put that in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/04-altmetric-transformed/ This way duckDB can make a join when querying over multiple parquet files.\n",
    "* Extract the SQL schema (schema-altmetric.sql) from the .parquet file and put it in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/04-altmetric-transformed/\n",
    "* **Get Overton data:** Repeat the altmetric steps, bun than for Overton.\n",
    "* **Get Gender data** query for the Author names and country codes, and run them over the gerderize api\n",
    "* **Get SDG data** query for the abstracts, and run abstracs larger than 100 tokens over the aurora-SDG api.\n",
