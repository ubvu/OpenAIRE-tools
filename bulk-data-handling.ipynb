    "# OpenAIRE Community Data Dump Handling: Extraction, Tranformation and Enrichment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will start with one of the [OpenAIRE Community Subgraphs](https://graph.openaire.eu/docs/downloads/subgraphs) to enrich that informatino for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data process will extract an [OpenAIRE community data dump from Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3974604), transforms it in to a portable file format .parquet (and updatable with changes for time seires analysis), that can be used to query with DuckDB, to enrich this with additional data  (also in .parquet, for join queries).\n",
    "\n",
    "This additional data can be societal impact data from [Altmetric.com](https://details-page-api-docs.altmetric.com/) or [Overton.io](https://app.overton.io/swagger.php), Gender data using [genderize.io](https://genderize.io/documentation), sdg classification using [aurora-sdg](https://aurora-universities.eu/sdg-research/sdg-api/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This script needs to be written in a way so that it can run every month using  the latest data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Processing steps\n",
    "\n",
    "* the folder ./data/ is put in .gitignore to prevent that bulk datais sent to a code repository. So make sure that folder exists, and mkdir if not exists. \n",
    "* The script downloads the lastest Data Dump Tar file from one selected community. See https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3974604 for the latest list. In our case the Aurora tar file. https://zenodo.org/records/14887484/files/aurora.tar?download=1\n",
    "  * Use the json record of zenodo to get to the latest record, and fetch the download link of the aurora.tar file. for example : https://zenodo.org/records/14887484/export/json or https://zenodo.org/api/records/14887484/versions/latest \n",
    "  Make the tar filename a variable, so it can be used for multiple community dumps.\n",
    "  Download the tar file in a target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/ where a subfolder is created using the filename and the timestamp. Make this also as a  variable to use later on.\n",
    "* Extract the tar file, to the compressed .json.gz files and put these in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/01-extracted/\n",
    "* Transform the compressed .json.gz files into a single .parquet file in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/02-transformed/\n",
    "Use instructions in sections \"Processing JSON files with DuckDB\" and \"Full dataset, bit by bit\" and \"Splitting and Processing JSON Files in Batches\" https://github.com/mosart/OpenAIRE-tools/blob/main/duckdb-querying.ipynb to start with. (be aware of error messages, and fix the issues to get all the data in)\n",
    "* Extract the SQL schema (schema-datadump.sql) from the .parquet file and put it in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/02-transformed/ This is needed for further processing of the records with DuckDB later on.\n",
    "Use instructions in section \"Extracting Schema from Parquet File\" https://github.com/mosart/OpenAIRE-tools/blob/main/duckdb-querying.ipynb to start with.\n",
    "* Query to get all identifiers: openaire id, doi, isbn, hdl, etc.\n",
    "* **Get Altmetric data:**\n",
    "* Extract the Altmetric data using the Identifiers. put that in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/03-altmetric-extracted/\n",
    "* Transform the Altmetric data to a single .parquet file, with the identifiers. put that in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/04-altmetric-transformed/ This way duckDB can make a join when querying over multiple parquet files.\n",
    "* Extract the SQL schema (schema-altmetric.sql) from the .parquet file and put it in target folder ./data/{filename+timestamp}/04-altmetric-transformed/\n",
    "* **Get Overton data:** Repeat the altmetric steps, bun than for Overton.\n",
    "* **Get Gender data** query for the Author names and country codes, and run them over the gerderize api\n",
    "* **Get SDG data** query for the abstracts, and run abstracs larger than 100 tokens over the aurora-SDG api.\n",

The suboxic zone, a thin interface between oxic and anoxic waters, still remains poorly understood because it has been undersampled. This has led to alternative concepts regarding the underlying processes that create it. Existing hypotheses suggest that the interface originates either by isopycnal intrusions that introduce oxygen or the dynamics of manganese redox cycling that are associated with the sinking of particles or chemosynthetic bacteria. Here we reexamine these concepts using high‐resolution oxygen, sulfide, nitrate, and particle concentration profiles obtained with sensors deployed on profiling floats. Our results show an extremely stable structure in density space over the entire basin with the exception of areas near the Bosporus plume and in the southern areas dominated by coastal anticyclones.

The surface-to-bottom temperature change over the last decade of sustained observation is equivalent to a heat uptake of 0.71 ± 0.09 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup> applied over the surface of Earth, 90% of it being found above 2000-m depth. The authors decompose the temperature trend pointwise into changes in isopycnal depth (heave) and temperature changes along an isopycnal (spiciness) to describe the mechanisms controlling the variability. The heave component dominates the global heat content increase, with the largest trends found in the Southern Hemisphere’s extratropics (0–2000 m) highlighting a volumetric increase of subtropical mode waters. Significant heave-related warming is also found in the deep North Atlantic and Southern Oceans (2000–4000 m), reflecting a potential decrease in deep water mass renewal rates. The spiciness component shows its strongest contribution at intermediate levels (700–2000 m), with striking localized warming signals in regions of intense vertical mixing (North Atlantic and Southern Oceans). Finally, the agreement between the independent Argo and repeat hydrography temperature changes at 2000 m provides an overall good confidence in the blended heat content evaluation on global and ocean scales but also highlights basin-scale discrepancies between the two independent estimates. Those mismatches are largest in those basins with the largest heave signature (Southern Ocean) and reflect both the temporal and spatial sparseness of the hydrography sampling. </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Observing system experiments (OSEs) are carried out over a 1-year period to quantify the impact of Argo observations on the Mercator Ocean 0.25° global ocean analysis and forecasting system. The reference simulation assimilates sea surface temperature (SST), SSALTO/DUACS (Segment Sol multi-missions dALTimetrie, d'orbitographie et de localisation précise/Data unification and Altimeter combination system) altimeter data and Argo and other in situ observations from the Coriolis data center. Two other simulations are carried out where all Argo and half of the Argo data are withheld. Assimilating Argo observations has a significant impact on analyzed and forecast temperature and salinity fields at different depths. Without Argo data assimilation, large errors occur in analyzed fields as estimated from the differences when compared with in situ observations. For example, in the 0–300 m layer RMS (root mean square) differences between analyzed fields and observations reach 0.25 psu and 1.25 °C in the western boundary currents and 0.1 psu and 0.75 °C in the open ocean. The impact of the Argo data in reducing observation–model forecast differences is also significant from the surface down to a depth of 2000 m. Differences between in situ observations and forecast fields are thus reduced by 20 % in the upper layers and by up to 40 % at a depth of 2000 m when Argo data are assimilated. At depth, the most impacted regions in the global ocean are the Mediterranean outflow, the Gulf Stream region and the Labrador Sea. A significant degradation can be observed when only half of the data are assimilated. Therefore, Argo observations matter to constrain the model solution, even for an eddy-permitting model configuration. The impact of the Argo floats' data assimilation on other model variables is briefly assessed: the improvement of the fit to Argo profiles do not lead globally to unphysical corrections on the sea surface temperature and sea surface height. The main conclusion is that the performance of the Mercator Ocean 0.25° global data assimilation system is heavily dependent on the availability of Argo data.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

We present an overview of the temporal and spatial characteristics of OHC variability and change as represented by an ensemble of dynamical and statistical ocean reanalyses (ORAs). Spatial maps of the 0-300 m layer show large regions of the Pacific and Indian Oceans where the interannual variability of the ensemble mean exceeds ensemble spread, indicating that OHC variations are well-constrained by the available observations over the period 1993-2009. At deeper levels, the ORAs are less well-constrained by observations with the largest differences across the ensemble mostly associated with areas of high eddy kinetic energy, such as the Southern Ocean and boundary current regions. Spatial patterns of OHC change for the period 1997-2009 show good agreement in the upper 300 m and are characterized by a strong dipole pattern in the Pacific Ocean. There is less agreement in the patterns of change at deeper levels, potentially linked to differences in the representation of ocean dynamics, such as water mass formation processes. However, the Atlantic and Southern Oceans are regions in which many ORAs show widespread warming below 700 m over the period 1997-2009. Annual time series of global and hemispheric OHC change for 0-700 m show the largest spread for the data sparse Southern Hemisphere and a number of ORAs seem to be subject to large initialization 'shock' over the first few years. In agreement with previous studies, a number of ORAs exhibit enhanced ocean heat uptake below 300 and 700 m during the mid-1990s or early 2000s. The ORA ensemble mean (+/- 1 standard deviation) of rolling 5-year trends in full-depth OHC shows a relatively steady heat uptake of approximately 0.9 +/- 0.8 W m(-2) (expressed relative to Earth's surface area) between 1995 and 2002, which reduces to about 0.2 +/- 0.6 W m(-2) between 2004 and 2006, in qualitative agreement with recent analysis of Earth's energy imbalance. There is a marked reduction in the ensemble spread of OHC trends below 300 m as the Argo profiling float observations become available in the early 2000s. In general, we suggest that ORAs should be treated with caution when employed to understand past ocean warming trends-especially when considering the deeper ocean where there is little in the way of observational constraints.

Oceanic particulate organic carbon (POC) is a relatively small (~4\\u2009Pg\\u2009C) but dynamic component of the global carbon cycle with fast mean turnover rates compared to other oceanic, continental and atmospheric carbon stocks. Biogeochemical models historically focused on reproducing the sinking flux of POC driven by large fast-sinking particles (bPOC). However, suspended and slow-sinking particles (sPOC) typically represent 80–90\\u2009% of the POC stock, and can make important seasonal contributions to vertical fluxes through the mesopelagic layer (200–1000\\u2009m). Recent developments in the parameterization of POC reactivity in the PISCES model (PISCESv2_RC) have greatly improved its ability to capture sPOC dynamics. Here we evaluated this model by matching 3D and 1D simulations with BGC-Argo and satellite observations in globally representative ocean biomes, building on a refined scheme for converting particulate backscattering profiles measured by BGC-Argo floats to POC. We show that PISCES captures the major features of sPOC and bPOC as seen by BGC-Argo floats across a range of spatiotemporal scales, from highly resolved profile time series to biome-aggregated climatological profiles. Our results also illustrate how the comparison between the model and observations is hampered by (1) the uncertainties in empirical POC estimation, (2) the imperfect correspondence between modelled and observed variables, and (3) the bias between modelled and observed physics. Despite these limitations, we identified characteristic patterns of model-observations misfits in the mesopelagic layer of subpolar and subtropical gyres. These misfits likely result from both suboptimal model parameters and model equations themselves, pointing to the need to improve the model representation of processes with a critical influence on POC dynamics, such as sinking, remineralization, (dis)aggregation and zooplankton activity. Beyond model evaluation results, our analysis identified inconsistencies between current estimates of POC from satellite and BGC-Argo data, as well as POC partitioning into phytoplankton, heterotrophs and detritus deduced from in situ bio-optical data. Our approach can help constrain POC stocks, and ultimately budgets, in the epipelagic and mesopelagic ocean.                         </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Recently, three-dimensional oceanic temperature anomalies optimally perturbing the North Atlantic Mean Temperature (NAMT) have been computed via an optimization procedure using a linear adjoint to a realistic ocean general circulation model. The spatial pattern of the identified perturbations, localized in the North Atlantic, has the largest magnitude between 1000 and 4000 m depth. In the present study, the impacts of these perturbations on NAMT, on the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and on climate in general are investigated in a global coupled model that uses the same ocean model as was used to compute the three-dimensional optimal perturbations. In the coupled model, these perturbations induce AMOC and NAMT anomalies peaking after 5 and 10 years, respectively, generally consistent with the ocean-only linear predictions. To further understand their impact, their magnitude was varied in a broad range. For initial perturbations with a magnitude comparable to the internal variability of the coupled model, the model response exhibits a strong signature in sea surface temperature and precipitation over North America and the Sahel region. The existence and impacts of these ocean perturbations have important implications for decadal prediction: they can be seen either as a source of predictability or uncertainty, depending on whether the current observing system can detect them or not. In fact, comparing the magnitude of the imposed perturbations with the uncertainty of available ocean observations such as Argo data or ocean state estimates suggests that only the largest perturbations used in this study could be detectable. This highlights the importance for decadal climate prediction of accurate ocean density initialisation in the North Atlantic at intermediate and greater depths.'''\"}]}\n",

The main goal of this paper is to quantify the contribution of systematic errors close to and away from land by examining the statistics of SMOS minus interpolated fields of in situ SSS before and after removal of climatological mean fields. Using interpolated fields of in situ SSS as reference, we find that the precision of monthly SMOS SSS anomalies, SSSANO</sub>, relative to a SMOS SSS monthly climatology computed over four years between 45°N and 45°S is 30% better than the one of SSS when considering pixels further than 1000 km from the coast. This improvement reaches 40% when all pixels are included. At 1600 km from the coast, the standard deviation of the difference between SMOS SSS and in situ interpolated fields is 0.15. These very encouraging results show that it is possible to correct part of the systematic errors in SMOS SSS from the SMOS SSS themselves, pending improvements in SMOS reconstructed brightness temperatures resulting from improved calibration and image reconstruction processes. The largest SSS anomalies are observed in the tropical Indian Ocean as related to Indian Ocean Dipole and in the tropical Pacific Ocean where latitudinal migration of the SSS minimum in the South Pacific Convergence Zone is related to El Niño Southern Oscillation phases and where strong SSS anomalies are observed in the Intertropical Convergence Zone during positive phases of ENSO in early 2010 and in late 2014, early 2015.'''\"}]}\n",

This deliverable is one component of the strategy toward this goal: to develop an Euro-Argo roadmap with regard to BCs. The other component of the task 2.3 strategy is related to using machine learning to improve Argo synergie with other observing systems in ocean state estimates. The participants to task 2.3 identified boundary systems of interest and covered by this deliverable: ● \\xa0the Gulf Stream (IFREMER), ● \\xa0the West Spitsbergen Current and East Greenland Current (BSH, IOPAN), ● \\xa0the BCs in the Western Mediterranean region (SOCIB, SU) ● \\xa0and the Gulf of Cadiz Current (IPMA) First we present the scientific rationales for observing these BC systems. Primarily because of their frontal intrinsic structure, BCs are associated with key scientific questions dealing with air-sea and open vs coastal interactions, with profound impact on other components of the climate system (the atmosphere or seaboard areas). This key ingredient, i.e. being a frontal structure, is also the origin of a large turbulent activity, which limits (i) the ability of Argo floats to remain in a BC regions and (ii) the representativity of Argo profiles in this realm of strong eddy field. Hence the need for a dedicated EA strategy with regard to BCs. Second, a detailed analysis of the historical Argo sampling of these BCs is provided. This analysis is characterised by a very large range of Argo floats configuration parameters as well as very heterogeneous sampling density. Some regions like the Gulf Stream have been fairly well sampled (compared to the core Argo target), while others very poorly, like the Balearic Current and Gulf of Cadiz. It is noted that no specific configuration parameters are being used systematically to optimise observation of the frontal structure and its eddy field. Last, we provide a first version for a European strategy plan with regard to the Argo extension in WBC and other boundary regions. This initial text lays out, for each BCs, the key European needs, existing capacities and current knowledge about what would be required, as well as the technological advances, to fulfill these needs. Among all these elements we highlight the need for a better informed strategy of numerical experiments based on a Virtual Fleet software to simulate Argo floats that will lead to determine the most appropriate sampling strategies (deployment plans and configuration parameters) in BCs. An initial version of this software has been released in June 2020. Partners are still developing experiments designs. The present strategy plan will thus be revisited in 2022 to take into account the results of these experiments.'''\"}]}\n",

Previous studies have warned that this “Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD)-like” warming pattern could yield more Arabian Sea cyclones, more extreme IOD events and decrease monsoonal rains. Here we show that CMIP5 models also produce an “IOD-like” pattern over the 1871–2016 period, in broad agreement with observations. Single-models ensemble simulations however indicate a strong aliasing of the warming pattern “signal” by the internal climate variability “noise” over that period. While the average Indian Ocean warming emerges around 1950 in CMIP5 and observations, regional contrasts are more difficult to detect. The only detectable signal by 2016 in CMIP5 is a stronger Arabian Sea than Bay of Bengal warming in >\\u200980% of the models, which is not detected in HadSST3 observations. Conversely, observations already detect a stronger Northern than Southern Indian ocean warming, while this signal only emerges by ~\\u20092060 in >\\u200980% of the models. Subsampling observations to only retain the most accurate values however indicate that this observed signal most likely results from sampling issues in the Southern hemisphere. In light of this large aliasing by internal climate variability and observational uncertainties, the broad agreement between CMIP5 and observations over 1871–2016 may be largely coincidental.

Since a pH sensor has become available that is suitable for this demanding autonomous measurement platform, the marine CO2 system can be observed independently and continuously by BGC-Argo floats. This opens the possibility to detect variability and long-term changes in interior ocean inorganic carbon storage and quantify the ocean sink for atmospheric CO2. In combination with a second parameter of the marine CO2 system, pH can be a useful tool to derive the surface ocean CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). The large spatiotemporal variability of the marine CO2 system requires sustained observations to decipher trends and punctual events (e.g., river discharge, phytoplankton bloom) but also puts a high emphasis on the quality control of float-based pH measurements. In consequence, as the interpretation of changes depends on accurate data, and because sensor offsets or drifts might appear, a consistent and rigorous correction procedure to process and quality-control the data has been established. By applying standardized routines of the Ago data management to pH measurements from a pH/O2 float pilot array in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, we investigate the uncertainties and lack of objective criteria associated with the standardized routines, notably the choice of the reference method for the pH correction (CANYON-B or LIRPH) as well the reference depth for this correction. For the studied float array, significant differences of ca. 0.02 pH units are observed between the two reference methods which can be used to correct float-pH data from water samples. Through comparison against discrete pH data from water samples, an assessment of the adjusted float-pH data quality is presented. The results point out noticeable discrepancies near the surface of &gt; 0.01 pH units. In the context of converting surface ocean pH measurements into pCO2 data for the purpose to derive air-sea CO2 fluxes, we conclude that the minimum accuracy requirement of 0.01 pH units (equivalent to the minimum pCO2 accuracy of 10 µatm for potential future inclusion into the SOCAT database) is not systematically achieved in the upper ocean. While the limited dataset and regional focus of our study provides only one showcase, it still calls for an additional independent pH reference in the surface ocean. We therefore propose a way forward to enhance the float-pH quality control procedure. In our analysis, the current philosophy of pH data correction against climatological reference data at one single depth in the deep ocean appears insufficient to assure adequate data quality in the surface ocean. Ideally, an additional reference point should be taken at or near the surface where the resulting pCO2 data are of the highest importance to monitor the air-sea exchange of CO2 and would have the potential to very significantly augment the impact of the current observation network.                         </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

The analysis focuses on the signature of the ocean large-scale climate fluctuations driven by the atmospheric forcing and do not address the mesoscale variability. We use the ECCO version 4 ocean reanalysis to unravel the role of ocean transport and surface buoyancy fluxes in the observed SSH, SST and OC variability. We show that the SSH regional variability is dominated by the steric effect (except at high latitude) and is mainly shaped by ocean heat transport divergences with some contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing that can be significant regionally (confirming earlier results). This is in contrast with the SST regional variability, which is the result of the compensation of surface heat fluxes by ocean heat transport in the mixed layer and arises from small departures around this background balance. Bringing together the results of SSH and SST analyses, we show that SSH and SST bear some common variability. This is because both SSH and SST variability show significant contributions from the surface heat fluxes forcing. It is evidenced by the high correlation between SST and buoyancy forced SSH almost everywhere in the ocean except at high latitude. OC, which is determined by phytoplankton biomass, is governed by the availability of light and nutrients that essentially depend on climate fluctuations. For this reason OC show significant correlation with SST and SSH. We show that the correlation with SST display the same pattern as the correlation with SSH with a negative correlation in the tropics and subtropics and a positive correlation at high latitude.

The first step uses an improved neural network approach to estimate the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance from Rrs. a(λ) and bbp(λ) are then estimated using the LS2 model (Loisel et al., 2018), which does not require spectral assumptions on IOPs and hence can assess a(λ) and bb(λ) at any wavelength at which Rrs(λ) is measured. Then, an inverse optimization algorithm is combined with an optical water class (OWC) approach to assess aphy(λ) and acdm(λ) from anw(λ).The proposed model is evaluated using an in situ dataset collected in open oceanic, coastal, and inland waters. Comparisons with other standard semi-analytical algorithms (QAA and GSM), as well as match-up exercises, have also been performed. The applicability of the algorithm on OLCI observations was assessed through the analysis of global IOPs spatial patterns derived from 3SAA and GSM.

The imposed perturbations act to increase the amount of heat available to melt ice, leading to a rapid Arctic sea ice retreat within 5 years after the perturbations are activated. In response, the AMOC gradually weakens over the next ~100 years. The AMOC changes can be explained by the accumulation in the Arctic and subsequent downstream propagation to the North Atlantic of buoyancy anomalies controlled by temperature and salinity. Initially, during the first decade or so, the Arctic sea ice loss results in anomalous positive heat and salinity fluxes in the subpolar North Atlantic, inducing positive temperature and salinity anomalies over the regions of oceanic deep convection. At first, these anomalies largely compensate one another, leading to a minimal change in upper ocean density and deep convection in the North Atlantic. Over the following years, however, more anomalous warm water accumulates in the Arctic and spreads to the North Atlantic. At the same time, freshwater that accumulates from seasonal sea ice melting over most of the upper Arctic Ocean also spreads southward, reaching as far as south of Iceland. These warm and fresh anomalies reduce upper ocean density and suppress oceanic deep convection. The thermal and haline contributions to these buoyancy anomalies, and therefore to the AMOC slowdown during this period, are found to have similar magnitudes.

However, a significant gap exists in the ocean observing system in polar regions, compared to most areas of the global ocean, hindering the reliability of ocean and sea ice forecasts.

Sea level is one of the 50 Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) listed by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) in climate change monitoring. In the past two decades, sea level has been routinely measured from space using satellite altimetry techniques. In order to address a number of important scientific questions such as \"Is sea level rise accelerating?\", \"Can we close the sea level budget?\", \"What are the causes of the regional and interannual variability?\", \"Can we already detect the anthropogenic forcing signature and separate it from the internal/natural climate variability?\", and \"What are the coastal impacts of sea level rise?\", the accuracy of altimetry-based sea level records at global and regional scales needs to be significantly improved. For example, the global mean and regional sea level trend uncertainty should become better than 0.3 and 0.5 mm year−1, respectively (currently 0.6 and 1–2 mm year−1). Similarly, interannual global mean sea level variations (currently uncertain to 2–3 mm) need to be monitored with better accuracy. In this paper, we present various data improvements achieved within the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) project on \"Sea Level\" during its first phase (2010–2013), using multi-mission satellite altimetry data over the 1993–2010 time span. In a first step, using a new processing system with dedicated algorithms and adapted data processing strategies, an improved set of sea level products has been produced. The main improvements include: reduction of orbit errors and wet/dry atmospheric correction errors, reduction of instrumental drifts and bias, intercalibration biases, intercalibration between missions and combination of the different sea level data sets, and an improvement of the reference mean sea surface. We also present preliminary independent validations of the SL_cci products, based on tide gauges comparison and a sea level budget closure approach, as well as comparisons with ocean reanalyses and climate model outputs.                     </jats:p>\\'\\'\\''}]}\n",

A subsurface‐eddy identification method, based on its steric dynamic height anomaly, is devised to assign Argo profiles to surface eddies (surfSIDDIES) or subsurface eddies (subSIDDIES). These westward‐propagating, long‐lived features (&gt;3 months) prevail over a preferential latitudinal band, forming a permanent structure linking the eastern to the western Indian Ocean, that we call the 'SIDDIES Corridor’. Key features have been revealed in the mean thermohaline vertical structure of these eddies. Anticyclonic SIDDIES are characterized by positive subsurface salinity anomalies, with subSIDDIES not exhibiting negative surface anomalies, as opposed to surfSIDDIES. Cyclonic subSIDDIES also occur, but their related salinity anomalies are weaker. SubSIDDIES exhibit two cores of different temperature polarities in their surface and subsurface levels. Cyclonic subSIDDIES have their cores at around 150‐200 m depth along the 25.4‐25.8 kg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> potential density layer with anticyclonic subSIDDIES having their cores at 250‐300 m along the 26‐26.4 kg m<jats:sup>−3</jats:sup> density layer. The SIDDIES corridor acts as a zonal pathway for both eddy‐types to advect water masses and biogeochemical properties across the basin. This study provides a new insight on heat/salt fluxes, showing that 58% (32%) of the total heat eddy‐flux is ascribed to cyclonic (anticyclonic) subSIDDIES, respectively, in the eastern South Indian Ocean.

We introduce a new method to correct the glider’s along-track coordinate, which is, in general, biased by the unsteady relative movements of the glider and the eddy, yielding large errors on horizontal derivatives. Here, we take advantage of the synopticity of satellite along-track altimetry to apply corrections on the glider’s position by matching in situ steric height with satellite-measured sea surface height. This relocation method allows recovering the eddy’s azimuthal symmetry, precisely estimating the rotation axis position, and computing reliable horizontal derivatives. It is shown to be particularly appropriate to compute the eddy’s cyclo-geostrophic velocity, relative vorticity, and shear strain, which are otherwise out of reach when using the glider’s raw traveled distance as a horizontal coordinate. The Ertel potential vorticity (PV) structure of the warm core ring is studied in details, and we show that the PV anomaly is entirely controlled by vortex stretching. Sign reversal of the PV gradient across the water column suggests that the ring might be baroclinically unstable. The PV gradient is also largely controlled by gradients of the vortex stretching term. We also show that the ring’s total energy partition is strongly skewed, with available potential energy being 3 times larger than kinetic energy.

The main result of this study is a strong cyclone‐anticyclone asymmetry of the eddy detection on the altimetry products AVISO/CMEMS in the Mediterranean Sea. Large‐scale cyclones having a characteristic radius larger than the local deformation radius are much less reliable than large‐scale anticyclones. We estimate that less than 60% of these cyclones detected on gridded altimetry product are reliable, while more than 85% of mesoscale anticyclones are reliable. Besides, both the barycenter and the size of these mesoscale anticyclones are relatively accurate. This asymmetry comes from the difference of stability between cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. Large mesoscale cyclones often split into smaller sub‐mesoscale structures having a rapid dynamical evolution. The numerical model CROCO‐MED60v40 shows that this complex dynamic is too fast and too small to be accurately captured by the gridded altimetry products. The spatio‐temporal interpolation smoothes out this sub‐mesoscale dynamics and tends to generate an excessive number of unrealistic mesoscale cyclones in comparison with the reference field. On the other hand, large mesoscale anticyclones, which are more robust and which evolve more slowly, can be accurately tracked by standard altimetry products. We also confirm that the AVISO/CMEMS products induce a bias on the eddy intensity.

Nevertheless, this statement has been put to question by recent regional studies showing the existence of inverse eddy SST anomalies: Cold Core anticyclones and, respectively, Warm Core cyclones. This study shows that the emergence of these inverse anomalies is a seasonal phenomenon that affects the life cycle of mesoscale eddies in the Mediterranean Sea. We use remote sensing observations and in situ data to analyse the eddy-induced SST anomaly over a 3-year period (2016–2018). We build an eddy core SST anomaly index to quantify the amount of Cold Core anticyclones and Warm Core cyclones all over the year and especially during the spring re-stratification period. We find that 70% of eddy anomalies are inverse in May and June both for cyclones and anticyclones. Regular temperature anomalies could reach 1.5 °C, while inverse ones are only present in the first 50 m of the oceanic layer and hardly exceed 1 °C. In order to understand the underlying dynamical processes, we construct a simple vertical column model to study the impact of the seasonal air–sea fluxes on the surface stratification inside and outside eddies. It is only by taking into account a differential diapycnal eddy mixing—increased in anticyclones and reduced in cyclones—that we reproduce correctly, in agreement with the observations, the surface temperature inversion in the eddy core. This simplified model suggests that vertical mixing modulation by mesoscale eddies might be the key mechanism that leads to the eddy–SSTA seasonal inversion in the ocean.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Oxygen optode measurements on floats and gliders suffer from a slow time response and various sources of drift in the calibration coefficients. Based on two dual-O2 Argo floats, we show how to post-correct for the effect of the optode's time response and give an update on optode in situ drift stability and in-air calibration. Both floats are equipped with an unpumped Aanderaa 4330 optode and a pumped Sea-Bird SBE63 optode. Response times for the pumped SBE63 were derived following Bittig et al.\\xa0(2014) and the same methods were used to correct the time response bias. Using both optodes on each float, the time response regime of the unpumped Aanderaa optode was characterized more accurately than previously possible. Response times for the pumped SBE63 on profiling floats are in the range of 25–40\\u202fs, while they are between 60 and 95\\u202fs for the unpumped 4330 optode. Our parameterization can be employed to post-correct the slow optode time response on floats and gliders. After correction, both sensors agree to within 2–3\\u202fµmol\\u2006kg−1 (median difference) in the strongest gradients (120\\u202fµmol\\u2006kg−1 change over 8\\u202fmin or 20\\u202fdbar) and better elsewhere. However, time response correction is only possible if measurement times are known, i.e., provided by the platform as well as transmitted and stored with the data. The O2 in-air measurements show a significant in situ optode drift of −0.40 and −0.27\\u202f%\\u202fyr−1 over the available 2 and 3 years of deployment, respectively. Optode in-air measurements are systematically biased high during midday surfacings compared to dusk, dawn, and nighttime. While preference can be given to nighttime surfacings to avoid this in-air calibration bias, we suggest a parameterization of the daytime effect as a function of the Sun's elevation to be able to use all data and to better constrain the result.

However, these coupled, global climate models cannot resolve important oceanic features such as the Agulhas Current and its leakage around South Africa, which a number of studies have suggested may act to balance MOC weakening in the future. To properly understand oceanic changes and feedbacks on anthropogenic climate change we need to substantially improve global ocean observations, particularly within boundary current regions such as the Agulhas Current, which represent the fastest warming regions across the world’s oceans. The South African science community, in collaboration with governing bodies and international partners, has recently established one of the world’s most comprehensive observational networks of a western boundary current system, measuring the Greater Agulhas Current System and its inter-ocean exchanges south of Africa. This observational network, through its design for long-term monitoring, collaborative coordination of resources and skills sharing, represents a model for the international community.

The difference in term of spatio-temporal resolution between the in-situ near-surface salinity and the two-dimensional satellite SSS results in a sampling mismatch uncertainty. The Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project has merged SSS from three satellite missions. Using an optimal interpolation, weekly and monthly SSS and their uncertainties are estimated at a 50 km spatial resolution over the global ocean. Over the 2016-2018 period the mean uncertainty on weekly CCI SSS is 0.13, whereas the standard deviation of weekly CCI minus in-situ Argo salinities is 0.24. Using high resolution SSS simulations, we estimate the expected uncertainty due to the CCI versus Argo sampling mismatch. Most of the largest spatial variability of the satellite minus Argo salinity are observed in regions with large mismatch. A quantitative validation is performed by considering the statistical distribution of the CCI minus Argo salinity normalized by the sampling and retrieval uncertainties. This quantity should follow a Gaussian distribution with a standard deviation of 1, if all uncertainty contributions are properly considered. We find that 1) the sampling mismatch can explain most of the observed differences between Argo and CCI data, especially for monthly products and in dynamical regions (river plumes, fronts), 2) overall, the uncertainties are well estimated in CCI version 3, much better compared to CCI version 2.

These simulations are performed as contributions to the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II). The study is Part II of our companion paper (Danabasoglu et al., 2014) which documented the mean states in the North Atlantic from the same models. A major focus of the present study is the representation of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) variability in the participating models. Relationships between AMOC variability and those of some other related variables, such as subpolar mixed layer depths, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and the Labrador Sea upper-ocean hydrographic properties, are also investigated. In general, AMOC variability shows three distinct stages. During the first stage that lasts until the mid- to late-1970s, AMOC is relatively steady, remaining lower than its long-term (1958–2007) mean. Thereafter, AMOC intensifies with maximum transports achieved in the mid- to late-1990s. This enhancement is then followed by a weakening trend until the end of our integration period. This sequence of low frequency AMOC variability is consistent with previous studies. Regarding strengthening of AMOC between about the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s, our results support a previously identified variability mechanism where AMOC intensification is connected to increased deep water formation in the subpolar North Atlantic, driven by NAO-related surface fluxes. The simulations tend to show general agreement in their temporal representations of, for example, AMOC, sea surface temperature (SST), and subpolar mixed layer depth variabilities. In particular, the observed variability of the North Atlantic SSTs is captured well by all models. These findings indicate that simulated variability and trends are primarily dictated by the atmospheric datasets which include the influence of ocean dynamics from nature superimposed onto anthropogenic effects. Despite these general agreements, there are many differences among the model solutions, particularly in the spatial structures of variability patterns. For example, the location of the maximum AMOC variability differs among the models between Northern and Southern Hemispheres.'''\"}]}\n",

Consequently, remote-sensing satellite observations and high-resolution regional weather forecasts at the ocean surface are difficult to assess. However, atmospheric data collected in the southern hemisphere summer of 2008 during the International Polar Year-BONUS-GoodHope campaign were used to validate two satellite data sets: the twice daily QuikSCAT winds and the daily OAflux data set of latent and sensible heat fluxes. The surface winds and heat fluxes forecasts produced by a regional atmospheric model were also assessed along the ship track. In this study, we have shown that the two data sets exhibited a very good accordance with daily in-situ observations. During the campaign, the correlation coefficients for wind speed and direction were 0.97 and 0.91, respectively, and those for latent and sensible heat fluxes were 0.92 and 0.90, respectively. The QuikSCAT wind speed was underestimated by 1.37 m/s relative to in-situ data, south of the Subtropical Front. Large differences in heat fluxes in both OAflux and the atmospheric model were observed when crossing the Subtropical Front and a warm eddy, as well as during a storm, when gale force winds reached more than 20 m/s. The two data sets were then used to assess the regional model forecasts over a larger area south of South Africa, not limited to the ship track. Most of the model errors were located in a region north of the Subtropical Front, where the sea surface temperature used by the model was not accurate enough to reproduce the relevant mesoscale oceanic features driving the spatial variability of the surface winds and heat fluxes. Finally, compared to in-situ and remote sensing observations, the numerical modelling weather forecast produced realistic atmospheric conditions over the sea south of the Subtropical Front.'''\"}]}\n",

Maximum interannual variability is found in the western Pacific warm pool and in both convergence zones, in relation to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. In the equatorial band, this later variability is due chiefly to the horizontal advection of low salinity waters from the western to the central-eastern basin during El Niño (and vice versa during La Niña), with contrasted evolution for the Eastern and Central Pacific ENSO types.

The north-western Mediterranean deep convection plays a crucial role in the general circulation and biogeochemical cycles of the Mediterranean Sea. The DEWEX (DEnse Water EXperiment) project aimed to better understand this role through an intensive observation platform combined with a modelling framework. We developed a 3 dimensional coupled physical and biogeochemical model to estimate the cycling and budget of dissolved oxygen in the entire north-western Mediterranean deep convection area over the period September 2012 to September 2013. After showing that the simulated dissolved oxygen concentrations are in a good agreement with the in situ data collected from research cruises and Argo floats, we analyze the seasonal cycle of the air-sea oxygen exchanges, as well as physical and biological oxygen fluxes, and we estimate an annual oxygen budget. Our study indicates that the annual air-to-sea fluxes in the deep convection area amounted to 20\\u2009mol\\u2009m−2\\u2009yr−1. 88\\u2009% of the annual uptake of atmospheric oxygen, i.e. 18\\u2009mol\\u2009m−2, occurred during the intense vertical mixing period.

Although the GS transport intensity presents a clear interannual variability, satellite observations reveal its mean path is stable. Numerical models can simulate some characteristics of the mean GS path, but persistent biases keep the GS separation and postseparation unstable and therefore unrealistic. This study investigates how the integration of ocean surface currents into the ocean–atmosphere coupling interface of numerical models impacts the GS. The authors show for the first time that the current feedback, through its eddy killing effect, stabilizes the GS separation and postseparation, resolving long-lasting biases in modeled GS path, at least for the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS). This key process should therefore be taken into account in oceanic numerical models. Using a set of oceanic and atmospheric coupled and uncoupled simulations, this study shows that the current feedback, by modulating the energy transfer from the atmosphere to the ocean, has two main effects on the ocean. On one hand, by reducing the mean surface stress and thus weakening the mean geostrophic wind work by 30%, the current feedback slows down the whole North Atlantic oceanic gyre, making the GS narrower and its transport weaker. Yet, on the other hand, the current feedback acts as an oceanic eddy killer, reducing the surface eddy kinetic energy by 27%.

Results are also compared to several widely used atmospheric re-analyses products such as the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-I), the ERA5, the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2), and the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR). It is demonstrated that satellite-based estimates of heat flux components are in better agreement with in-situ buoy observations than re-analysis-based products. As such, the satellite products can be instrumental in diagnosing model performance and utilized for addressing research issues related to atmospheric and oceanic dynamics in the Indian Monsoon. It was found that the meanQ(net)is higher in the AS than in the BoB, yet the phase of their monthly time series is well correlated with ocean heat gain/loss extremes.

It was found that over most of the open Indian Ocean, at least half of the seasonal SST magnitude is explained by the seasonalQ(net). Given the small (&lt;= 1 month) delay between an annual maximum of the seasonal mixed layer heat content rate of change and the seasonalQ(net), it is concluded thatQ(net)data presented in this paper are generally consistent with independently observed SST.'''\"}]}\n",

We then assess for the first time the impact of ocean intrinsic variability on DWF with a novel perturbed initial state ensemble method. Finally, we identify the main physical mechanisms driving water mass transformations. NEMOMED12 reproduces accurately the deep convection chronology between late January and March, itslocation off the Gulf of Lions although with a southward shift and its magnitude. It fails to reproduce the Western Mediterranean Deep Waters salinification and warming, consistently with too strong a surface heat loss. The Ocean Intrinsic Variability modulates half of the DWF area, especially in the open-sea where the bathymetry slope is low. It modulates marginally (3–5%) the integrated DWF rate, but its increase with time suggests its impact could be larger at interannual timescales. We conclude that ensemble frameworks are necessary to evaluate accurately numerical simulations of DWF. Each phase of DWF has distinct diapycnal and thermohaline regimes: during preconditioning, the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation is driven by exchanges with the Algerian basin. During the intense mixing phase, surface heat fluxes trigger deep convection and internal mixing largely determines the resulting deep water properties. During restratification, lateral exchanges and internal mixing are enhanced. Finally, isopycnal mixing was shown to play a largerole in water mass transformations during the preconditioning and restratification phases.'''\"}]}\n",

The role of MLD variations in shaping the phytoplankton phenology was explored in the Mediterranean Sea, a basin displaying contrasting phenological regimes. A database of MLD estimations was merged with ocean color chlorophyll concentrations ([Chl]SAT) to generate concomitant annual MLD and [Chl]SAT cycles. Several indices were calculated to quantitatively analyze these cycles. The relevance of indices summarizing the temporal difference between main characteristics of MLD and [Chl]SAT cycles was emphasized. As previously observed, two dominant phenological regimes coexist in the Mediterranean Sea. The first is marked by a typical spring bloom, as in temperate regions. The second displays a low seasonality and an absence of an intense [Chl]SAT peak as in subtropical areas. The MLD is shown to play a key role in determining the dominant phenological regime in a given area. Results also show that regions having low seasonality display concomitant MLD and [Chl]SAT maxima, whereas [Chl]SAT peaks are generally observed 30 days after MLD peaks in regions with strongest seasonality. Over the whole basin, [Chl]SAT increase starts 1 month after the initiation of MLD deepening.

Understanding decadal and longer-term variability of the SPCZ fresh pool and of the salinity front located at its southeastern margin has been limited by the scarcity of instrumental sea surface salinity (SSS) measurements. This study uses coral δ18</sub>O as a proxy for SSS to extend the salinity record back to the 1880s, from three different locations across the SSS front: Fiji, Tonga, and Rarotonga (FTR region). High percentages of observed SSS variance are explained by multicoral δ<sub>18</sub>O mean composite at each site. At the interannual time scale, the salinity front displacement over the last 200 years follows the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index. The different El Niño flavors are observable in the amplitude of the salinity front interannual displacement. However, no significant changes in either the frequency or the amplitude of its displacements were observed. At longer time scales, the timing and magnitude of the freshening trend vary among sites. The earliest freshening onset of about −0.06 psu decade<sup>−1</sup> is detected in Fiji (around 1865), then Rarotonga (around 1939), and Tonga (around 1982). The role of atmospheric freshwater fluxes on SSS variability is evaluated by comparing coral SSS to historical precipitation data. The results suggest that, despite the known influence of the interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) negative phases on increasing atmospheric freshwater fluxes and lowering SSS in the FTR region, ocean dynamics has a dominant influence at decadal time scale and in the onset of freshening trends.'''\"}]}\n",

Characterizing the spatio-temporal arrangements of inorganic nutrients is critical to improve our understanding of the marine biological primary production. Among the processes contributing to nutrient distributions, diapycnal diffusion plays a crucial role for the supply of nutrients to the surface productive zone, and for the equilibration of vertical differences in nutrient concentrations induced by large scale thermohaline circulation. This is the case in the western Mediterranean Sea, where Levantine intermediate waters (LIW), that circulate below the surface layer, regionally distribute the nutrient stocks conveyed from the eastern basin or provided by terrestrial inputs, atmospheric deposition, and remineralization of organic matter. In the present study, we focus on the role played by diffusive processes in the LIW fertilization, considering long-term observations of thermohaline staircases. In association with the unprecedented contribution of profiling floats to explore their structural changes, the fine characterization of western Mediterranean thermohaline staircases sampled during the cruise PEACETIME can be carried out from a different perspective. Observations revealed that thermohaline staircases develop over epicentral regions confined inside large scale circulation features and sustained by saltier LIW inflows on the periphery. As observed in the Algerian Basin, these epicentral regions are thought to be site of active mixing, with changes of seawater properties by about +\\u20090.06\\u2009°C in temperature and +\\u20090.02 in salinity during the four years of observation. In-situ lateral density ratios are analysed in the view of theoretical predictions to identify and untangle (i) salt fingering as driver of water mass conversion, with (ii) isopycnal diffusion as spreader of heat and salt from the surrounding sources. In the Tyrrhenian Sea, the resulting nutrient fluxes bring upward from deep waters 5\\u2009μmol/m2/d in nitrate, which represents one fourth of LIW fertilization by diapycnal diffusion, but remains a secondary contributor to the enrichment of Ionian water inflows.                         </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Indeed, current Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projections of an AMOC slowdown in the twenty-first century based on climate models are attributed to the inhibition of deep convection in the North Atlantic. However, observational evidence for this linkage has been elusive: there has been no clear demonstration of AMOC variability in response to changes in deep-water formation. The motivation for understanding this linkage is compelling, since the overturning circulation has been shown to sequester heat and anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean. Furthermore, AMOC variability is expected to impact this sequestration as well as have consequences for regional and global climates through its effect on the poleward transport of warm water. Motivated by the need for a mechanistic understanding of the AMOC, an international community has assembled an observing system, Overturning in the Subpolar North Atlantic Program (OSNAP), to provide a continuous record of the transbasin fluxes of heat, mass, and freshwater, and to link that record to convective activity and water mass transformation at high latitudes. OSNAP, in conjunction with the Rapid Climate Change–Meridional Overturning Circulation and Heatflux Array (RAPID–MOCHA) at 26°N and other observational elements, will provide a comprehensive measure of the three-dimensional AMOC and an understanding of what drives its variability.

Following recent advances in platform      and sensor technologies, even greater opportunity exists now than 20 years ago to (i)      improve Argo’s global coverage and value beyond the original design, (ii) extend Argo to      span the full ocean depth, (iii) add biogeochemical sensors for improved understanding      of oceanic cycles of carbon, nutrients, and ecosystems, and (iv) consider experimental      sensors that might be included in the future, for example to document the spatial and      temporal patterns of ocean mixing. For Core Argo and each of these enhancements,      the past, present, and future progression along a path from experimental deployments      to regional pilot arrays to global implementation is described.

However, a 2011 seismic reflection cruise conducted by BGR and Ifremer near the North–Western African margin of Morocco, MIRROR Leg 2, revealed the presence of a meddy south of the Azores front and very close to the Morocco coastline. This unusual location of a strong Mediterranean Water anomaly is confirmed by other data. Moreover, meddies are long‐lived structures whose dynamics and dissipation are not yet completely understood. Recently, theoretical studies have revealed critical‐level baroclinic instabilities of compact, lens‐like vortices. This theory supports the slow growth of azimuthal eigenmodes along critical surfaces which leads to the formation of arms winding around the vortex developing sharp internal fronts. These structures are very thin and spatially intermittent and are identified for the first time in a seismic dataset; this is made possible by the length of seismic sections at high lateral resolution.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

The Persian Gulf produces high-salinity water (Persian Gulf Water, PGW hereafter), which flows into the Sea of Oman via the Strait of Hormuz. Beyond the Strait of Hormuz, the PGW cascades down the continental slope and spreads in the Sea of Oman under the influence of the energetic mesoscale eddies. The PGW outflow has different thermohaline characteristics and pathways, depending on the season. In spring 2011, the Phys-Indien experiment was carried out in the Arabian Sea and in the Sea of Oman. The Phys-Indien 2011 measurements, as well as satellite observations, are used here to characterize the circulation induced by the eddy field and its impact on the PGW pathway and evolution.  During the spring intermonsoon, an anticyclonic eddy is often observed at the mouth of the Sea of Oman. It creates a front between the eastern and western parts of the basin. This structure was observed in 2011 during the Phys-Indien experiment. Two energetic eddies were also present along the southern Omani coast in the Arabian Sea. At their peripheries, ribbons of freshwater and cold water were found due to the stirring created by the eddies.  The PGW characteristics are strongly influenced by these eddies. In the western Sea of Oman, in 2011, the PGW was fragmented into filaments and submesoscale eddies. It also recirculated locally, thus creating salty layers with different densities. In the Arabian Sea, a highly saline submesoscale lens was recorded offshore. Its characteristics are analyzed here and possible origins are proposed. The recurrence of such lenses in the Arabian Sea is also briefly examined.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

The use of sea level is motivated by its better correlation with interior pressure or quasi‐geostrophic potential vorticity (PV) compared to sea surface temperature and sea surface salinity, and, by its observability via satellite altimetry. The simplest method of reconstruction relies on a linear estimation of pressure at depth from sea level. Another method consists in linearly estimating PV from sea level first and then performing a PV inversion. The last method considered, labeled SQG for surface quasi‐geostrophy, relies on a PV inversion but assumes no PV anomalies. The first two methods show comparable skill at levels above −800 m. They moderately outperform SQG which emphasizes the difficulty of estimating interior PV from surface variables. Over the 250–1,000 m depth range, the three methods skillfully reconstruct pressure at wavelengths between 500 and 200 km whereas they exhibit a rapid loss of skill between 200 and 100 km wavelengths.

This method (FLAVOR for Fluorescence to Algal communities Vertical distribution in the Oceanic Realm) uses as input only the shape of the fluorescence profile associated with its acquisition date and geo‐location. The neural network is trained and validated using a large database including 896 concomitant in situ vertical profiles of High‐Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) pigments and fluorescence. These profiles were collected during 22 oceanographic cruises representative of the global ocean in terms of trophic and oceanographic conditions, making our method applicable to most oceanic waters. FLAVOR is validated with respect to the retrieval of both [Chl] and phytoplankton size indices using an independent in situ data set and appears to be relatively robust spatially and temporally. To illustrate the potential of the method, we applied it to in situ measurements of the BATS (Bermuda Atlantic Time Series Study) site and produce monthly climatologies of [Chl] and associated phytoplankton size indices. The resulting climatologies appear very promising compared to climatologies based on available in situ HPLC data. With the increasing availability of spatially and temporally well‐resolved data sets of chlorophyll fluorescence, one possible global‐scale application of FLAVOR could be to develop 3‐D and even 4‐D climatologies of [Chl] and associated composition of phytoplankton communities.

Based on climatological output of a general circulation ocean model, we show here that its development consists of two phases. In summer, the BL is relatively shallow and thin but subsurface temperature maxima are intense. The latter develop as a result of the specific seasonality of the freshwater discharge in this area, which limits the mixed layer to a very thin depth while the intense radiative heat flux penetrates significantly below, thereby heating the subsurface waters protected from air‐sea interactions and inducing a barrier layer between the mixed layer and the ocean interior. In winter, the BL development is due to a surface decrease in salinity associated with the surface freshwater capping, which decouples the pycnocline, and hence the winter mixed layer, from the thermocline. The mechanism is ubiquitous in the sense that it is very similar to that of other areas at the same latitude, as well as at high latitudes in regions of seasonal surface freshening. Results are discussed in the light of a simple linear equation linking the BL development to time evolution of Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Surface Salinity stratification.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Vortical structures remnant of wintertime deep vertical mixing events were regularly sampled by the different observing platforms.

However, continuous, high‐frequency, observations of these quantities have been limited to date. Multiple years of full‐depth daily observations from moored instruments in the South Atlantic at 34.5°S are combined with satellite observations to resolve the volume transports in both the upper and abyssal MOC cells, and the associated full‐depth meridional heat transport (MHT), on daily to interannual timescales. A newly developed method for combining satellite sea level observations with historical hydrographic measurements was used to estimate daily full‐depth ocean profiles of temperature in the ocean interior where mooring coverage is sparse. The average MHT during 2013–2017 is 0.5 PW, with a daily standard deviation of 0.8 PW. The MHT variability is most strongly driven by the geostrophic relative velocity contributions (horizontal density‐gradient changes). This variability is highly correlated with the volume transport variability of the MOC upper cell (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>\\xa0=\\xa00.96) and modestly anti‐correlated (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic>\\xa0=\\xa0−0.52) with the abyssal cell variations.

The observed sea level trend pattern in this region results from the superposition of two main signals: (1) a strong broad-scale V-shaped positive trend anomaly extending to mid-latitudes in the central Pacific and (2) another very strong positive trend anomaly located in the western tropical Pacific within about 120° E–160° E and 20° S–20° N latitude. In this study, we focus on the tropical Pacific (20° N–20° S) where the strongest trends in sea level are observed. By making use of in situ observational data, we study the impact of thermocline depth changes on steric sea level between the surface and 700\\xa0m and its relation with the altimetry-based observed sea level changes. This is done by calculating the time-varying thermocline depth (using the 20\\xa0°C isotherm depth as a proxy) and estimating the sea level trend patterns of the thermocline-attributed individual steric components. We show that it is essentially the vertical movement of the thermocline that governs most of the observed sea level changes and trends in the tropical Pacific. Furthermore, we also show that in the equatorial band, the changes in the upper ocean thermal structure are in direct response to the zonal wind stress. Away from the equatorial band (say, within 5°–15° latitude), the changes in the upper ocean thermal structure are consistent with the wind stress-generated Rossby waves. We also estimate the contribution of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) on the vertical thermal structure of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Removing the IPO contribution to the upper layer steric sea level provides a non-negligible residual pattern, suggesting that IPO-related internal ocean variability alone cannot account for the observed trend patterns in the Pacific sea level. It is likely that the residual signal may also reflect non-linear interactions between different natural modes like El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), IPO, etc.'''\"}]}\n",

This study attempts to identify robust signals of ocean heat content change in ORA-20C and detect contamination by model errors, initial condition uncertainty, surface fluxes and observing system changes. It is shown that ORA-20C trends and variability in the first part of the century result from the surface fluxes and model drift towards a warmer mean state and weak meridional overturning circulation. The impact of the observing system in correcting the mean state causes the deceleration of the warming trend and alters the long-term climate signal. The ensemble spread reflects the long-lasting memory of the initial conditions and the convergence of the system to a solution compatible with surface fluxes, the ocean model and observational constraints. Observations constrain the ocean heat uptake trend in the last decades of the twentieth century, which is similar to trend estimations from the post-satellite era. An ocean heat budget analysis attributes ORA-20C heat content changes to surface fluxes in the first part of the century. The heat flux variability reflects spurious signals stemming from ERA-20C surface fields, which in return result from changes in the atmospheric observing system.

In this study, we use an observationally constrained, physically consistent global ocean model to examine the sensitivity of heat distribution in the recently ventilated subsurface Pacific (RVP) sector of the Southern Ocean to changes in ocean temperature and salinity.

Next, we use an ensemble of adjoint sensitivity experiments to quantify the sensitivity of the RVP heat content to changes in ocean temperature and salinity. In terms of sensitivities to surface ocean properties, we find that RVP heat content is most sensitive to anomalies along the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC), upstream of the subduction hotspots.

We find that year-to-year SSS variability is particularly strong in the north-eastern part of the bay. Over recent years, this variability takes the form of two successive and opposite phases: a saltening phase from mid-2009 to late 2010, immediately followed by a freshening phase from late 2010 to late 2011. The typical magnitude of each anomalous spell is about one in the practical salinity scale, making this area one of the most variable of the tropical oceans at interannual timescales. A simple mixed-layer salt budget indicates that year-to-year large-scale SSS variability in the Northern Bay of Bengal is primarily driven by freshwater flux variability with a correlation of 0.68, with rather independent contributions from precipitation and river run-off. The oceanic surface circulation variability contributes less systematically to the large-scale SSS evolution in the Northern Bay of Bengal over the entire record with a correlation of 0.13, despite a strong contribution at times, in particular, during the 2011 positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) freshening.'''\"}]}\n",

The present study defines new interpolation functions for hydrological data. These functions are applied to generate climatological maps of temperature–salinity distribution with a 25 m depth interval and a 30 km space interval (MEDTRANS data set). The data undergo rigorous initial data quality control, having passed several filtering procedures. The gridding is done on neutral density surfaces, which allows better representation of thermohaline fronts for the same gridding radius. The multi-pass Barnes optimum interpolation procedure with spatially variable size of the gridding window is used. The shape of the window accounts for the dominant along-isobath direction of water mass transport over steeply sloping topography. A local ratio of topographic to planetary β-effects is used to define the shape of the window as a function of the relative importance of the topographic influence. The N/f ratio is applied to account for the baroclinic compensation decay of the topographic influence on water mass transport with the distance from the bottom. The gridded fields are available at the website of the Centre of Oceanography of the University of Lisbon (http://co.fc.ul.pt/en/data).  The MEDTRANS climatology gives more details of the distribution of water characteristics in the subtropical northeastern Atlantic than other alternative climatologies and is able to reproduce a number of dynamic features described in the literature: the acceleration in the meanders of the Azores current; the cyclonic gyre in the Gulf of Cadiz; and the splitting and separation of the Mediterranean Water (MW) outflow in two veins near the Gorringe and Galicia banks.

Since a pH sensor has become available that is principally suitable for use on demanding autonomous measurement platforms, the marine CO2 system can be observed independently and continuously by Biogeochemical Argo floats. This opens the potential to detect variability and long-term changes in interior ocean inorganic carbon storage and quantify the ocean sink for atmospheric CO2. In combination with a second parameter of the marine CO2 system, pH can be a useful tool to derive the surface ocean CO2 partial pressure (pCO2). The large spatiotemporal variability in the marine CO2 system requires sustained observations to decipher trends and study the impacts of short-term events (e.g., eddies, storms, phytoplankton blooms) but also puts a high emphasis on the quality control of float-based pH measurements. In consequence, a consistent and rigorous quality control procedure is being established to correct sensor offsets or drifts as the interpretation of changes depends on accurate data. By applying current standardized routines of the Argo data management to pH measurements from a pH\\u2009/\\u2009O2 float pilot array in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean, we assess the uncertainties and lack of objective criteria associated with the standardized routines, notably the choice of the reference method for the pH correction (CANYON-B, LIR-pH, ESPER-NN, and ESPER-LIR) and the reference depth for this adjustment. For the studied float array, significant differences ranging between ca. 0.003\\u2009pH units and ca.\\xa00.04\\u2009pH units are observed between the four reference methods which have been proposed to correct float pH data. Through comparison against discrete and underway pH data from other platforms, an assessment of the adjusted float pH data quality is presented. The results point out noticeable discrepancies near the surface of &gt;\\u20090.004 pH units. In the context of converting surface ocean pH measurements into pCO2 data for the purpose of deriving air–sea CO2 fluxes, we conclude that an accuracy requirement of 0.01\\u2009pH units (equivalent to a pCO2 accuracy of 10\\u2009µatm as a minimum requirement for potential future inclusion in the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas, SOCAT, database) is not systematically achieved in the upper ocean. While the limited dataset and regional focus of our study do not allow for firm conclusions, the evidence presented still calls for the inclusion of an additional independent pH reference in the surface ocean in the quality control routines. We therefore propose a way forward to enhance the float pH quality control procedure. In our analysis, the current philosophy of pH data correction against climatological reference data at one single depth in the deep ocean appears insufficient to assure adequate data quality in the surface ocean. Ideally, an additional reference point should be taken at or near the surface where the resulting pCO2 data are of the highest importance to monitor the air–sea exchange of CO2 and would have the potential to very significantly augment the impact of the current observation network.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

In 2018 we celebrated 25\\u202fyears of development of radar altimetry, and the progress achieved by this methodology in the fields of global and coastal oceanography, hydrology, geodesy and cryospheric sciences. Many symbolic major events have celebrated these developments, e.g., in Venice, Italy, the 15th (2006) and 20th (2012) years of progress and more recently, in 2018, in Ponta Delgada, Portugal, 25 Years of Progress in Radar Altimetry. On this latter occasion it was decided to collect contributions of scientists, engineers and managers involved in the worldwide altimetry community to depict the state of altimetry and propose recommendations for the altimetry of the future. This paper summarizes contributions and recommendations that were collected and provides guidance for future mission design, research activities, and sustainable operational radar altimetry data exploitation. Recommendations provided are fundamental for optimizing further scientific and operational advances of oceanographic observations by altimetry, including requirements for spatial and temporal resolution of altimetric measurements, their accuracy and continuity. There are also new challenges and new openings mentioned in the paper that are particularly crucial for observations at higher latitudes, for coastal oceanography, for cryospheric studies and for hydrology.       The paper starts with a general introduction followed by a section on Earth System Science including Ocean Dynamics, Sea Level, the Coastal Ocean, Hydrology, the Cryosphere and Polar Oceans and the “Green” Ocean, extending the frontier from biogeochemistry to marine ecology. Applications are described in a subsequent section, which covers Operational Oceanography, Weather, Hurricane Wave and Wind Forecasting, Climate projection. Instruments’ development and satellite missions’ evolutions are described in a fourth section. A fifth section covers the key observations that altimeters provide and their potential complements, from other Earth observation measurements to in situ data. Section 6 identifies the data and methods and provides some accuracy and resolution requirements for the wet tropospheric correction, the orbit and other geodetic requirements, the Mean Sea Surface, Geoid and Mean Dynamic Topography, Calibration and Validation, data accuracy, data access and handling (including the DUACS system). Section 7 brings a transversal view on scales, integration, artificial intelligence, and capacity building (education and training). Section 8 reviews the programmatic issues followed by a conclusion. At the forefront of this support, we must obviously mention the space agencies CNES, ESA and NASA which have played and still play a decisive role in the development and launch of several prominent altimetry missions from the outset. Other agencies such as DLR, EUMETSAT, ISRO, NOAA, NSOAS and organizations such as CMEMS, also contribute significantly to developments in all forms of altimetry.'''\"}]}\n",

SAMW ventilates the subtropical thermocline on decadal timescales, providing nutrients for low‐latitude productivity and potentially trapping anthropogenic carbon in the deep ocean interior for centuries. In this work, we investigate the spatial structure and timescales of mode water export and associated thermocline ventilation. We use passive tracers in an eddy‐permitting, observationally‐informed Southern Ocean model to identify the pathways followed by mode waters between their formation regions and the areas where they first enter the subtropics. We find that the pathways followed by the mode water tracers are largely set by the mean geostrophic circulation. Export from the Indian and Central Pacific mode water pools is primarily driven by large‐scale gyre circulation, whereas export from the Australian and Atlantic pools is heavily influenced by the ACC. Export from the Eastern Pacific mode water pool is driven by a combination of deep boundary currents and subtropical gyre circulation. More than 50% of each mode water tracer reaches the subtropical thermocline within 50 years, with significant variability between pools. The Eastern Pacific pathway is especially efficient, with roughly 80% entering the subtropical thermocline within 50 years.

INDO12 is a 1/12° regional version of the NEMO physical ocean model covering the whole Indonesian EEZ (Exclusive Economic Zone). It has been developed and is now running every week in the framework of the INDESO (Infrastructure Development of Space Oceanography) project implemented by the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries. The initial hydrographic conditions as well as open-boundary conditions are derived from the operational global ocean forecasting system at 1/4° operated by Mercator Océan. Atmospheric forcing fields (3-hourly ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast) analyses) are used to force the regional model. INDO12 is also forced by tidal currents and elevations, and by the inverse barometer effect. The turbulent mixing induced by internal tides is taken into account through a specific parameterisation. In this study we evaluate the model skill through comparisons with various data sets including outputs of the parent model, climatologies, in situ temperature and salinity measurements, and satellite data. The biogeochemical model results assessment is presented in a\\xa0companion paper (Gutknecht et\\xa0al., 2015). The simulated and altimeter-derived Eddy Kinetic Energy fields display similar patterns and confirm that tides are a dominant forcing in the area. The volume transport of the Indonesian throughflow (ITF) is in good agreement with the INSTANT estimates while the transport through Luzon Strait is, on average, westward but probably too weak. Compared to satellite data, surface salinity and temperature fields display marked biases in the South China Sea. Significant water mass transformation occurs along the main routes of the ITF and compares well with observations. Vertical mixing is able to modify the South and North Pacific subtropical water-salinity maximum as seen in T–S diagrams. In spite of a few weaknesses, INDO12 proves to be able to provide a very realistic simulation of the ocean circulation and water mass transformation through the Indonesian Archipelago. Work is ongoing to reduce or eliminate the remaining problems in the second INDO12 version.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Based on the mean estimate of the three Argo gridded products considered, we provide a decadal ocean heat content estimate (over 2005-2014), down to 2000 m, of 0.76 ± 0.14 W m-2</SUP> and its spatial pattern since 2005 with unprecedented data coverage. We find that the southern hemisphere explains 90% of the net ocean heat uptake located around 40°S mainly for the Indian and Pacific oceans that corresponds to the center of their subtropical gyres. We find that this rapid upper ocean warming is linked to a poleward shift of mean wind stress curl enhancing Ekman pumping for the 45°S-60°S band. Therefore, the increase of Ekman pumping steepens the isopycnal surface and can enhance heat penetration into the deeper layers of the ocean. We also highlight a relative consistency between the year-to-year net top-of-the-atmosphere flux inferred by satellite measurements and the ocean heating rates (correlation coefficient of 0.53). We conclude that there is no strong evidence of missing energy in the climate system because of remaining large uncertainties in the observing system.'''\"}]}\n",

Variations of some parameters involved in air ‐ sea exchanges (wind, coefficient of transfer used in the latent heat flux formulation, and constant additive heat flux) showed that the characteristics of water masses and the volume of dense water formed during convection cannot be simply related to the time‐integrated buoyancy budget over the autumn ‐ winter period.

Starting in 2017, the project aims at setting up a computational web-based platform focusing on satellite sea surface salinity data, supporting studies on enhanced validation and scientific process over the ocean. It has been designed in close collaboration with a dedicated science advisory group in order to achieve three main objectives: gathering all the data required to exploit satellite sea surface salinity data, systematically producing a wide range of metrics for comparing and monitoring sea surface salinity products’ quality, and providing user-friendly tools to explore, visualize and exploit both the collected products and the results of the automated analyses. The Salinity Pi-MEP is becoming a reference hub for the validation of satellite sea surface salinity missions by providing valuable information on satellite products (SMOS, Aquarius, SMAP), an extensive in situ database (e.g., Argo, thermosalinographs, moorings, drifters) and additional thematic datasets (precipitation, evaporation, currents, sea level anomalies, sea surface temperature, etc.). Co-localized databases between satellite products and in situ datasets are systematically generated together with validation analysis reports for 30 predefined regions. The data and reports are made fully accessible through the web interface of the platform. The datasets, validation metrics and tools (automatic, user-driven) of the platform are described in detail in this paper. Several dedicated scienctific case studies involving satellite SSS data are also systematically monitored by the platform, including major river plumes, mesoscale signatures in boundary currents, high latitudes, semi-enclosed seas, and the high-precipitation region of the eastern tropical Pacific. Since 2019, a partnership in the Salinity Pi-MEP project has been agreed between ESA and NASA to enlarge focus to encompass the entire set of satellite salinity sensors.

Using the Southern Ocean State Estimate (SOSE), this study determines the vertical modes describing the Southern Ocean thermohaline structure between 5 and 2000 m.

These two modes present circumpolar patterns that can be closely related with standard frontal definitions. By projecting any given hydrographic profile onto the SOSE-based modes, it is possible to determine its position relative to the fronts. The projection is successfully applied on the hydrographic profiles of the WOCE SR3 section.

Some of these technologies have been available for years while others have only recently emerged. Use of these technologies is critical to improve understanding of the processes that control abundances, distributions and composition of plankton, provide data necessary to constrain and improve ecosystem and biogeochemical models, and forecast changes in marine ecosystems in light of climate change. In this paper we begin by providing the motivation for plankton observations, quantification and diversity qualification on a global scale. We then expand on the state-of-the-art, detailing a variety of relevant and (mostly) mature technologies and measurements, including bulk measurements of plankton, pigment composition, uses of genomic, optical and acoustical methods as well as analysis using particle counters, flow cytometers and quantitative imaging devices. We follow by highlighting the requirements necessary for a plankton observing system, the approach to achieve it and associated challenges. We conclude with ranked action-item recommendations for the next 10 years to move toward our vision of a holistic ocean-wide plankton observing system. Particularly, we suggest to begin with a demonstration project on a GO-SHIP line and/or a long-term observation site and expand from there, ensuring that issues associated with methods, observation tools, data analysis, quality assessment and curation are addressed early in the implementation. Global coordination is key for the success of this vision and will bring new insights on processes associated with nutrient regeneration, ocean production, fisheries and carbon sequestration.'''\"}]}\n",

Both datasets show similar interannual variability patterns in relation with known climate modes and reasonable phase agreement in key regions. Due to the scarcity of the observational dataset, we then largely rely on the model to describe the interannual MLD variations in more detail. MLD interannual variability is two to four times smaller than the seasonal cycle. A large fraction of MLD interannual variations is linked to large-scale climate modes, with the exception of coastal and subtropical regions where interannual signature of small-scale structures dominates. The Indian Ocean Dipole is responsible for most variations in the 10°N-10°S band, with positive phases being associated with a shallow MLD in the equatorial and south-eastern Indian Ocean and a deepening in the south-central Indian Ocean. The El Niño signature is rather weak, with moderate MLD shoaling in autumn in the eastern Arabian Sea. Stronger than usual monsoon jets are only associated with a very modest MLD deepening in the southern Arabian Sea in summer. Finally, positive Indian Ocean Subtropical Dipoles are associated with a MLD deepening between 15 and 30°S.

A regression method based on observations of the energy budget over 1971–2017 is used to estimate the histeffCS (4.34 [2.17; 22.83] K: median and 5%–95% range).

We described new sea surface CO2 observations in the south-western Indian Ocean obtained in January 2020 when a strong bloom event occurred south-east of Madagascar and extended eastward in the oligotrophic Indian Ocean subtropical domain. Compared to previous years\\xa0(1991–2019) we observed very low fCO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations (CT) in austral summer 2020, indicative of a biologically driven process. In the bloom, the anomaly of fCO2 and CT reached respectively −33\\u2009µatm and −42\\u2009µmol\\u2009kg−1, whereas no change is observed for alkalinity\\xa0(AT). In January 2020 we estimated a local maximum of air–sea CO2 flux at 27∘\\u2009S of −6.9\\u2009mmol\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1\\xa0(ocean sink) and −4.3\\u2009mmol\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1 when averaging the flux in the band 26–30∘\\u2009S. In the domain 25–30∘\\u2009S,\\xa050–60∘\\u2009E we estimated that the bloom led to a regional carbon uptake of about −1\\u2009TgC\\xa0per\\xa0month in January 2020, whereas this region was previously recognized as an ocean CO2 source or near equilibrium during this season. Using a neural network approach that reconstructs the monthly fCO2 fields, we estimated that when the bloom was at peak in December 2019 the CO2 sink reached −3.1\\xa0(±1.0)\\u2009mmol\\u2009m−2\\u2009d−1 in the band 25–30∘\\u2009S; i.e. the model captured the impact of the bloom. Integrated in the domain restricted to 25–30∘\\u2009S,\\xa050–60∘\\u2009E, the region was a CO2 sink in December 2019 of −0.8\\u2009TgC\\xa0per\\xa0month compared to a CO2 source of +0.12\\xa0(±0.10)\\u2009TgC\\xa0per\\xa0month in December when averaged over the period 1996–2018. Consequently in 2019 this region was a stronger CO2 annual sink of −8.8\\u2009TgC\\u2009yr−1 compared to −7.0\\xa0(±0.5)\\u2009TgC\\u2009yr−1 averaged over 1996–2018. In austral summer 2019–2020, the bloom was likely controlled by a relatively deep mixed-layer depth during the preceding winter (July–September 2019) that would supply macro- and/or micro-nutrients such as iron to the surface layer to promote the bloom that started in November 2019 in two large rings in the Madagascar Basin. Based on measurements in January 2020, we observed relatively high N2\\xa0fixation rates (up to 18\\u2009nmol\\xa0N\\u2009L−1\\u2009d−1), suggesting that diazotrophs could play a role in the bloom in the nutrient-depleted waters. The bloom event in austral summer 2020, along with the new carbonate system observations, represents a benchmark case for complex biogeochemical model sensitivity studies (including the N2\\xa0fixation process and iron supplies) for a better understanding of the origin and termination of this still “mysterious” sporadic bloom and its impact on ocean carbon uptake in the future.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

It is where the atmosphere sets the ocean in motion, climate/weather-relevant air–sea processes occur, and pollutants (i.e., plastic, anthropogenic carbon dioxide, radioactive/chemical waste) enter the sea. Hence, accurate estimates and forecasts of physical and biogeochemical processes at this interface are critical for sustainable blue economy planning, growth, and disaster mitigation. Such estimates and forecasts rely on accurate and integrated in situ and satellite surface observations. High-impact uses of ocean surface observations of essential ocean/climate variables (EOVs/ECVs) include (1) assimilation into/validation of weather, ocean, and climate forecast models to improve their skill, impact, and value; (2) ocean physics studies (i.e., heat, momentum, freshwater, and biogeochemical air–sea fluxes) to further our understanding and parameterization of air–sea processes; and (3) calibration and validation of satellite ocean products (i.e., currents, temperature, salinity, sea level, ocean color, wind, and waves). We review strengths and limitations, impacts, and sustainability of in situ ocean surface observations of several ECVs and EOVs. We draw a 10-year vision of the global ocean surface observing network for improved synergy and integration with other observing systems (e.g., satellites), for modeling/forecast efforts, and for a better ocean observing governance. The context is both the applications listed above and the guidelines of frameworks such as the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) (both co-sponsored by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO, IOC–UNESCO; the World Meteorological Organization, WMO; the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP; and the International Science Council, ISC). Networks of multiparametric platforms, such as the global drifter array, offer opportunities for new and improved in situ observations. Advances in sensor technology (e.g., low-cost wave sensors), high-throughput communications, evolving cyberinfrastructures, and data information systems with potential to improve the scope, efficiency, integration, and sustainability of the ocean surface observing system are explored.'''\"}]}\n",

Here, the origins and dominant pathways of this variability are investigated with an ocean analysis product (EN4), an ocean state estimate (ECCOv4), and idealized modeling approaches. Sustained increases and decreases of intermediate temperature in the SPG correlate with long‐lasting warm and cold states of the upper ocean with the largest anomalous vertical heat exchanges confined to the vicinity of continental boundaries and strong ocean currents. In particular, vertical diffusive processes along the boundaries of the Labrador, Irminger, and Newfoundland basins are important drivers of the recent intermediate depth warming trend observed during 1996–2014. The overall effect of those processes is captured by a one‐dimensional diffusive model with appropriate boundary‐like parametrization and demonstrated through the boundary‐focused downward propagation of a passive tracer in a 3‐D numerical simulation. Our results imply that the slow and quasi‐periodic ventilation of intermediate thermohaline properties and associated heat uptake in the SPG are not strictly driven by convection‐restratification events in the open seas but also receives a key contribution from boundary sinking and mixing.

The WTA is divided into four boxes which represent the main temporal and spatial heterogeneities of this region. An analysis of error of each term pointed out that the mean net surface heat fluxes are systematically underestimated by 20 W m<jats:sup>−2</jats:sup>. A correction of this term provides realistic estimates of the vertical mixing which was obtained as residual term. In agreement with previous studies, the results show that surface flux is the most important process that governs the seasonal cycle of the heat content. Changes in shortwave radiation and latent heat fluxes dictate the oceanic response to the meridional migration of the ITCZ. Along the equator, surface fluxes modulate the annual cycle of ML temperature, but are strongly balanced by horizontal advection. The entrainment term proves a small contribution to the cooling of the ML. On an interannual time scale, the strong positive (negative) SST anomalies observed in 2010 (2012) were generated during the previous winter in both years, mainly north of 10°N, during which the wind anomalies were at the origin of intense heat loss anomalies.

Because the PSB is at the base of the Arctic Ocean food chain, it is crucial to understand how changes in the Arctic environment will affect it. Green Edge was a large multidisciplinary, collaborative project bringing researchers and technicians from 28 different institutions in seven countries together, aiming at understanding these changes and their impacts on the future. The fieldwork for the Green Edge project took place over two years (2015 and 2016) and was carried out from both an ice camp and a research vessel in Baffin Bay, in the Canadian Arctic. This paper describes the sampling strategy and the dataset obtained from the research cruise, which took place aboard the Canadian Coast Guard ship (CCGS) Amundsen in late spring and early summer 2016. The sampling strategy was designed around the repetitive, perpendicular crossing of the marginal ice zone (MIZ), using not only ship-based station discrete sampling but also high-resolution measurements from autonomous platforms (Gliders, BGC-Argo floats …) and under-way monitoring systems. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.17882/86417 (Bruyant et al., 2022).                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

This analysis demonstrated that the shallow hydrothermal sources present along the Tonga‐Kermadec arc are responsible for the high concentrations observed in the photic layer. Nevertheless, in contrast to what has been observed for deep hydrothermal plumes, our results highlighted the rapid decrease in DFe concentrations near shallow hydrothermal sources. This is likely due to a shorter residence time of surface water masses combined with several biogeochemical processes at play (precipitation, scavenging, biological uptake, and photoreduction). This study clearly highlights the role of shallow hydrothermal sources on the DFe cycle within the Tonga‐Kermadec arc where a strong link to biological activity in surface waters can be assessed, despite the small but significant fraction of DFe ultimately stabilized. It also emphasizes the need to consider the impact of these sources for a better understanding of the global iron cycle.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

After more than a decade of shallow convection, deep convection returned to the Irminger Sea in 2008 and occurred several times since then to reach exceptional convection depths (&gt;\\u20091500\\u2009m) in 2015 and 2016. Additionally, deep mixed layers deeper than 1600\\u2009m were also reported southeast of Cape Farewell in 2015. In this context, we used Argo data to show that deep convection occurred southeast of Cape Farewell (SECF) in 2016 and persisted during two additional years in 2017 and 2018 with a maximum convection depth deeper than 1300\\u2009m. In this article, we investigate the respective roles of air–sea buoyancy flux and preconditioning of the water column (ocean interior buoyancy content) to explain this 4-year persistence of deep convection SECF. We analyzed the respective contributions of the heat and freshwater components. Contrary to the very negative air–sea buoyancy flux that was observed during winter 2015, the buoyancy fluxes over the SECF region during the winters of 2016, 2017 and 2018 were close to the climatological average. We estimated the preconditioning of the water column as the buoyancy that needs to be removed (B) from the end-of-summer water column to homogenize it down to a given depth. B was lower for the winters of 2016–2018 than for the 2008–2015 winter mean, especially due to a vanishing stratification from 600 down to ∼1300\\u2009m. This means that less air–sea buoyancy loss was necessary to reach a given convection depth than in the mean, and once convection reached 600\\u2009m little additional buoyancy loss was needed to homogenize the water column down to 1300\\u2009m. We show that the decrease in B was due to the combined effects of the local cooling of the intermediate water (200–800\\u2009m) and the advection of a negative S anomaly in the 1200–1400\\u2009m layer. This favorable preconditioning permitted the very deep convection observed in 2016–2018 despite the atmospheric forcing being close to the climatological average.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

This has resulted in low confidence ascribed to twenty-first-century projections of the state of the SO from previous generations of models.

Additionally, a comprehensive overview of CMIP6 performance relative to CMIP3 and CMIP5 is presented. CMIP6 models show improved performance in the surface wind stress forcing, simulating stronger and less equatorward-biased wind fields, translating into an improved representation of the Ekman upwelling over the Drake Passage latitudes. An increased number of models simulate an Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) transport within observational uncertainty relative to previous generations; however, several models exhibit extremely weak transports. Generally, the upper SO remains biased warm and fresh relative to observations, and Antarctic sea ice extent remains poorly represented.

In this study, we first characterize the interannual variability of this phenomenon by a thorough reanalysis of observations in order to establish reference time series. These quantitative indicators include 31 observed years for the yearly maximum mixed layer depth over the period 1980–2013 and a detailed multi-indicator description of the period 2007–2013. Then a 1980–2013 hindcast simulation is performed with a fully-coupled regional climate system model including the high-resolution representation of the regional atmosphere, ocean, land-surface and rivers. The simulation reproduces quantitatively well the mean behaviour and the large interannual variability of the DWF phenomenon. The model shows convection deeper than 1000 m in 2/3 of the modelled winters, a mean DWF rate equal to 0.35 Sv with maximum values of 1.7 (resp. 1.6) Sv in 2013 (resp. 2005). Using the model results, the winter-integrated buoyancy loss over the Gulf of Lions is identified as the primary driving factor of the DWF interannual variability and explains, alone, around 50 % of its variance. It is itself explained by the occurrence of few stormy days during winter. At daily scale, the Atlantic ridge weather regime is identified as favourable to strong buoyancy losses and therefore DWF, whereas the positive phase of the North Atlantic oscillation is unfavourable. The driving role of the vertical stratification in autumn, a measure of the water column inhibition to mixing, has also been analyzed. Combining both driving factors allows to explain more than 70 % of the interannual variance of the phenomenon and in particular the occurrence of the five strongest convective years of the model (1981, 1999, 2005, 2009, 2013). The model simulates qualitatively well the trends in the deep waters (warming, saltening, increase in the dense water volume, increase in the bottom water density) despite an underestimation of the salinity and density trends. These deep trends come from a heat and salt accumulation during the 1980s and the 1990s in the surface and intermediate layers of the Gulf of Lions before being transferred stepwise towards the deep layers when very convective years occur in 1999 and later. The salinity increase in the near Atlantic Ocean surface layers seems to be the external forcing that finally leads to these deep trends. In the future, our results may allow to better understand the behaviour of the DWF phenomenon in Mediterranean Sea simulations in hindcast, forecast, reanalysis or future climate change scenario modes. The robustness of the obtained results must be however confirmed in multi-model studies.'''\"}]}\n",

Earlier studies have pointed out systematic differences between Sea Surface Salinity retrieved from L-band radiometric measurements and measured in situ, that depend on Sea Surface Temperature (SST). We investigate how to cope with these differences given existing physically based radiative transfer models. In order to study differences coming from seawater dielectric constant parametrization, we consider the model of Somaraju and Trumpf (2006) (ST) which is built on sound physical bases and close to a single relaxation term Debye equation. While ST model uses fewer empirically adjusted parameters than other dielectric constant models currently used in salinity retrievals, ST dielectric constants are found close to those obtained using the Meissner and Wentz (2012) (MW) model. The ST parametrization is then slightly modified in order to achieve a better fit with seawater dielectric constant inferred from SMOS data. Upgraded dielectric constant model is intermediate between KS and MW models. Systematic differences between SMOS and in situ salinity are reduced to less than +/-0.2 above 0&amp;amp;#176;C and within +/-0.05 between 7 and 28&amp;amp;#176;C.

This method uses a statistical classifier (a PCM: Profile Classification Model) to organise and select more appropriately reference data for the quality control of an Argo float. The PCM based selection is able to distinguish profiles from different dynamical regimes of the ocean (e.g. eddies, fronts, quiescent water masses). Thus, selecting reference data out of the same dynamical regimes as the Argo float data to be quality controlled ensures more robust and relevant reference statistics. We show that this new DMQC-PCM method is able to improve the detection of salinity drift and temperature or salinity outliers. We further show that the new method, when combined with the standard salinity calibration method, is able to reduce the error on the correction while preserving confidence in this correction amplitude. We further provide an implementation plan for the DMQC-PCM method. The goal of this implementation plan is to make the method easily accessible to Argo QC operators. It is based on a collection of fully documented Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of the method with only open source software already available online freely.

The main fronts, normally defined at subsurface, are shown to have more distinct seasonal characteristics in SSS than in SST.  The interannual variations in SSS are more closely linked to variations in upstream sea-ice cover than surface forcing. SSS and sea-ice variations show distinct phases, with large biannual variations in the early 1990s, weaker variations in the 2000s and larger variations again from 2009 onwards. The calving of the Mertz Glacier Tongue in February 2010 leads to increased sea-ice cover and widespread freshening of the surface layers from 2011 onwards.

Specifically, initial linear optimal perturbations (LOPs) in temperature and salinity that vary with depth, longitude, and latitude are computed, and the maximum impact on the ocean of these perturbations is evaluated in a realistic ocean general circulation model. The computations of the LOPs involve a maximization procedure based on Lagrange multipliers in a nonautonomous context. To assess the impact of these perturbations four different measures of the North Atlantic Ocean state are used: meridional volume and heat transports (MVT and MHT) and spatially averaged sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean heat content (OHC). It is shown that these metrics are dramatically different with regard to predictability. Whereas OHC and SST can be efficiently modified only by basin-scale anomalies, MVT and MHT are also strongly affected by smaller-scale perturbations. This suggests that instantaneous or even annual-mean values of MVT and MHT are less predictable than SST and OHC. Only when averaged over several decades do the former two metrics have predictability comparable to the latter two, which highlights the need for long-term observations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in order to accumulate climatically relevant data. This study also suggests that initial errors in ocean temperature of a few millikelvins, encompassing both the upper and deep ocean, can lead to ~0.1-K errors in the predictions of North Atlantic sea surface temperature on interannual time scales. This transient error growth peaks for SST and OHC after about 6 and 10 years, respectively, implying a potential predictability barrier.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

In 2010, the NAOS (Novel Argo Observing System) project was selected as part of the French \"Investissements d\\'Avenir\" Equipex program. The objectives of NAOS were to consolidate the French contribution to Argo\\'s core mission (global temperature and salinity measurements down to 2000 m), and also to develop the future generation of French Argo profiling floats and prepare the next phase of the Argo program with an extension to the deep ocean (Deep Argo), biogeochemistry (BGC-Argo) and polar seas. This paper summarizes how NAOS has met its objectives. The project significantly boosted France\\'s contribution to Argo\\'s core mission by deploying more than 100 NAOS standard Argo profiling floats. In addition, NAOS deployed new-generation floats as part of three scientific experiments: biogeochemical floats in the Mediterranean Sea, biogeochemical floats in the Arctic Ocean, and deep floats with oxygen sensors in the North Atlantic. The experiment in the Mediterranean Sea, launched in 2012, implemented and maintained a network of BGC-Argo floats at basin scale for the first time. The 32 BGC-Argo floats deployed and about 4000 BGC profiles collected have vastly improved characterization of the biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics of the Mediterranean. Meanwhile, experiments in the Arctic and in the North Atlantic, starting in 2015 and deploying 20 Arctic BGC floats and 23 deep floats, have provided unique observations on biogeochemical cycles in the Arctic and deep-water masses, as well as ocean circulation variability in the North Atlantic. NAOS has therefore paved the way to the new operational phase of the Argo program in France that includes BGC and Deep Argo extensions. The objectives and characteristics of this new phase of Argo-France are discussed in the conclusion.\\'\\'\\''}]}\n",

The budgets are decomposed into a basin averaged surface component, lateral boundary components (through the Gibraltar and the Dardanelles Straits), a river input component and a content change component. An assessment of the different methods and observational products that have been used to quantify each of these components is presented. The values for the long term average of each component are also updated based on existing literature and a first estimate of heat fluxes associated with the riverine input has been produced. Special emphasis is put on the characterization of associated uncertainties and proposals for advancing current knowledge are presented for each budget component. With the present knowledge of the different components, the Mediterranean budgets can be closed within the range of uncertainty. However, the uncertainty range remains relatively high for several terms, particularly the basin averaged surface heat fluxes. Consequently, the basin averaged heat budget remains more strongly constrained by the Strait of Gibraltar heat transport than by the surface heat flux. It is worth remarking that if a short (∼few years) averaging period is used, then the heat content change must also be considered to constrain the heat budget. Concerning the water and salt fluxes, the highest uncertainties are found in the direct estimates of the Strait of Gibraltar water and salt transport. Therefore, the indirect estimate of those transports using the budget closure leads to smaller uncertainties than the estimates based on direct observations. Finally, estimates of Mediterranean heat and salt content trends are also reviewed. However, these cannot be improved through the indirect estimates due to the large temporal uncertainties associated to the surface fluxes and the fluxes through Gibraltar. The consequences of these results for estimates of the Mediterranean temperature and salinity trends obtained from numerical modelling are also considered'''\"}]}\n",

The difference in the size of the basins induces disparities both in the forcing modes and in the dynamics of the tropical waves, which form a single quasi-stationary wave system. For Rossby waves at mid-latitudes, a wide range of periods is considered, varying from a few days to several million years when very-long-period Rossby waves winding around the subtropical gyres are hypothesized. This review focuses on the resonant forcing of Rossby waves that seems ubiquitous: the quasi-geostrophic adjustment of the oceans favors natural periods close to the forcing period, while those far from it are damped because of friction. Prospective work concentrates on the resonant forcing of dynamical systems in subharmonic modes. According to this new concept, the development of ENSO depends on its date of occurrence.

Measurements from these missions are the only means to probe the very-near surface salinity (top cm), providing a unique monitoring capability for the interfacial exchanges of water between the atmosphere and the upper-ocean, and delivering a wealth of information on various salinity processes in the ocean, linkages with the climate and water cycle, including land-sea connections, and providing constraints for ocean prediction models. The satellite SSS data are complimentary to the existing in situ systems such as Argo that provide accurate depiction of large-scale salinity variability in the open ocean but under-sample mesoscale variability, coastal oceans and marginal seas, and energetic regions such as boundary currents and fronts. In particular, salinity remote sensing has proven valuable to systematically monitor the open oceans as well as coastal regions up to approximately 40 km from the coasts. This is critical to addressing societally relevant topics, such as land-sea linkages, coastal-open ocean exchanges, research in the carbon cycle, near-surface mixing, and air-sea exchange of gas and mass. In this paper, we provide a community perspective on the major achievements of satellite SSS for the aforementioned topics, the unique capability of satellite salinity observing system and its complementarity with other platforms, uncertainty characteristics of satellite SSS, and measurement versus sampling errors in relation to in situ salinity measurements. We also discuss the need for technological innovations to improve the accuracy, resolution, and coverage of satellite SSS, and the way forward to both continue and enhance salinity remote sensing as part of the integrated Earth Observing System in order to address societal needs.'''\"}]}\n",

Our results point out that a grid‐spacing of 1/24° on the horizontal and 50 m on the vertical homogeneously distributed are required to account for a correct transport of surface and subsurface water masses properties and their in‐route transformation by mixing. Preliminary Lagrangian analyses highlight the primary role of the upper‐ocean mesoscale eddies on water masses transport and fate, with a particular emphasis on Antarctic Intermediate Waters (AAIWs) dynamics and characteristics. We evaluate the numerical results against observations (AVISO data and Argo floats profiles). Modeled and observed eddies were examined in number, polarity, size, trajectory, and for their contribution to AAIW properties. A clear asymmetry, in number and radius, emerges between cyclones and anticyclones. The high‐resolution simulation was the most energetic, with more abundant and smaller structures than those detected in AVISO. However, eddy statistics compare reasonably well in terms of mean pathways when restricted to Agulhas Rings, which are on average quasi‐Gaussian in shape. Regionally, the Ertel potential vorticity anomaly is marked at the surface by a temporal variability with winter intensification, directly reflected in the seasonal cycle of the eddies number.

Based on shipborne observations acquired within the Uruguayan Economic Exclusive Zone (EEZ), combined with satellite data and an eddy tracking algorithm, we analyze the cross-shelf exchanges during May 2016, when the BMC was in an anomalous northern position. Two types of shelf water export were observed triggered by mesoscale dynamics: one was the export of shallow Rio de la Plata Plume waters driven off-shelf by the retroflection of the Brazil Current. This export formed a 70 km wide, 20 m deep filament that propagated offshore at 0.3 m s<jats:sup>–1</jats:sup>, with a transport of 0.42 Sv. It lasted about 10 days before being mixed with ambient Confluence waters by strong winds.

We show that geostrophic currents derived from satellite altimetry over the slope can be useful to track this subsurface off-shelf export as they are significantly correlated with absolute velocity measurements at this depth.

Coastal observations should sample the two-way interactions between nearshore, estuarine and shelf processes and open ocean processes, while accounting for the different pace of circulation drivers, such as the fast atmospheric, hydrological and tidal processes and the slower general ocean circulation and climate scales. Because of these challenges, high-resolution models can serve as connectors and integrators of coastal continuum observations.

CERA‐20C provides a 10 member ensemble of reanalyses to account for errors in the observational record as well as model error.

The dynamical model and the data assimilation systems initially developed for NWP had been modified to take into account the evolution of the radiative forcing and the observing system. To limit the impact of changes in the observing system throughout the century, only conventional surface observations have been used in the atmosphere.

The quality of CERA‐20C has been evaluated against other centennial reanalyses and independent observations. Although CERA‐20C inherits some limitations of ERA‐20C to represent correctly the tropical cyclones in the first part of the century, it shows significant improvements in the troposphere, compared to ERA‐20C and 20CRv2c (the twentieth century reanalysis produced by NOAA/CIRES).

The latter are fed by “leakiness” from the DWBC in the Newfoundland Basin. However, the cause of this leakiness has not yet been explored mechanistically. Here the statistics and dynamics of the DWBC leakiness in the Newfoundland Basin are explored using two float datasets and a high-resolution numerical model. The float leakiness around Flemish Cap is found to be concentrated in several areas (hot spots) that are collocated with bathymetric curvature and steepening. Numerical particle advection experiments reveal that the Lagrangian mean velocity is offshore at these hot spots, while Lagrangian variability is minimal locally. Furthermore, model Eulerian mean streamlines separate from the DWBC to the interior at the leakiness hot spots. This suggests that the leakiness of Lagrangian particles is primarily accomplished by an Eulerian mean flow across isobaths, though eddies serve to transfer around 50% of the Lagrangian particles to the leakiness hot spots via chaotic advection, and rectified eddy transport accounts for around 50% of the offshore flow along the southern face of Flemish Cap. Analysis of the model’s energy and potential vorticity budgets suggests that the flow is baroclinically unstable after separation, but that the resulting eddies induce modest modifications of the mean potential vorticity along streamlines. These results suggest that mean uncompensated leakiness occurs mostly through inertial separation, for which a scaling analysis is presented.

The most recent of these data sets, prepared with a coastal concern in the frame of the ESA EO4SIBS project, provides statistics of eddy properties that, in comparison with earlier products, are closer to model simulations, in particular for coastal anticyclones. More importantly, the subsurface signature of eddies reconstructed from BGC-Argo floats data is more consistent when the EO4SIBS data set is used to relocate the profiles into an eddy-centric coordinate system.

It is shown that the PF is independent of the position of the sea ice edge and is a shelf slope current constrained by potential vorticity. The main driver of interannual variability in SST is the variability of the Atlantic Water temperature, which has significantly increased since 2005. The SST gradient associated with the PF has also increased after 2005, preventing sea ice from extending south of the front during winter in recent years.

In the North-East Atlantic Ocean, the Bay of Biscay is an intersection between a coastal constrained dynamics (wide continental shelf and shelf break regions) and an eastern boundary circulation system. In this framework, the eddy kinetic energy is one order of magnitude lower than in western boundary systems. To explore this coastal complex system, a high resolution (1\\u2009km, 100 vertical sigma layers) model experiment including tidal dynamics over a period of 10 years (2001–2010) has been implemented. The ability of the numerical environment to reproduce main patterns over interannual scales is demonstrated. Based on this experiment, the features of the (sub)mesoscale processes are described in the deep part of the region (i.e. abyssal plain and continental slope). A system with the development of mixed layer instabilities at the end of winter is highlighted. Beyond confirming an observed behaviour of seasonal (sub)mesoscale activity in other regions, the simulated period allows exploring the interannual variability of these structures. A relationship between winter maximum of mixed layer depth and the intensity of (sub)mesoscale related activity (vertical velocity, relative vorticity) is revealed and can be explained by large scale atmospheric forcings (e.g. the cold winter in 2005). The first high resolution exploration of this 3D coastal system shows the importance of (sub)mesoscale activity in this region and its evolution implying a potential significant impact on vertical and horizontal mixing.                         </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

We find that phenology metrics derived from both contemporary platforms match with a high degree of precision (within the same 5-day period). The remotely-sensed surface signatures reflect the overall water column dynamics and successfully capture Chl-a variability related to convective mixing.

Here, we use a dataset protocol for 1970–2008—with six instrumental bias adjustments applied to expendable bathythermograph (XBT) data, and mapped by six research groups—to evaluate the spatiotemporal spread in upper OHCA estimates arising from two choices: 1) those arising from instrumental bias adjustments and 2) those arising from mathematical (i.e., mapping) techniques to interpolate and extrapolate data in space and time. We also examined the effect of a common ocean mask, which reveals that exclusion of shallow seas can reduce global OHCA estimates up to 13%. Spread due to mapping method is largest in the Indian Ocean and in the eddy-rich and frontal regions of all basins. Spread due to XBT bias adjustment is largest in the Pacific Ocean within 30°N–30°S. In both mapping and XBT cases, spread is higher for 1990–2004. Statistically different trends among mapping methods are found not only in the poorly observed Southern Ocean but also in the well-observed northwest Atlantic. Our results cannot determine the best mapping or bias adjustment schemes, but they identify where important sensitivities exist, and thus where further understanding will help to refine OHCA estimates.

The focus of this study is on how the annual mean and the seasonal cycle of the MLD relate to various forcing characteristics in different parts of the world’s oceans, and how anomalous variations in the monthly mean MLD relate to anomalous atmospheric forcings. By analysing both ocean reanalysis data and the single-column ocean model, regions with different dominant forcings and different mean and variability characteristics of the MLD can be identified. Many of the global oceans’ MLD characteristics appear to be directly linked to the different atmospheric forcing characteristics at different locations. Here, heating and wind-stress are identified as the main drivers; in some, mostly coastal, regions the atmospheric salinity forcing also contributes. The annual mean MLD is more closely related to the annual mean wind-stress and the MLD seasonality is more closely related to the seasonality in heating. The single-column ocean model, however, also points out that the MLD characteristics over most global ocean regions, and in particular in the tropics and subtropics, cannot be maintained by local atmospheric forcings only, but are also a result of ocean dynamics that are not simulated in a single-column ocean model.

We have applied usual regression methods to an in situ data set of particulate organic carbon (POC), total chlorophyll-a (TChla), optical particulate backscattering coefficient (bbp), and 19 years of monthly TChla and bbp ocean colour data. Results of the regression analysis have been used to calculate phytoplankton carbon biomass (Cphyto) and POC from: i) BGC-Argo float observations; ii) oceanographic cruises, and iii) satellite data.

Thus, the community can respond to societal challenges and stakeholders needs, developing a variety of ﬁt-for- purpose services such as the Copernicus Marine Service. The combination of state-of-the- art observations and forecasting provides new opportunities for downstream services in response to the needs of the heavily populated Mediterranean coastal areas and to climate change. The challenge over the next decade is to sustain ocean observations within the research community, to monitor the variability at small scales, e.g., the mesoscale/submesoscale, to resolve the sub-basin/seasonal and inter-annual variability in the circulation, and thus establish the decadal variability, understand and correct the model-associated biases and to enhance model-data integration and ensemble forecasting for uncertainty estimation. Better knowledge and understanding of the level of Mediterranean variability will enable a subsequent evaluation of the impacts and mitigation of the effect of human activities and climate change on the biodiversity and the ecosystem, which will support environmental assessments and decisions. Further challenges include extending the science-based added-value products into societal relevant downstream services and engaging with communities to build initiatives that will contribute to the 2030 Agenda and more speciﬁcally to SDG14 and the UN’s Decade of Ocean Science for sustainable development, by this contributing to bridge the science-policy gap.

Iceland-Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) is exported from the Nordic Seas into the Iceland Basin to feed the lower limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. The Bight Fracture Zone (BFZ) is known to be a major route for ISOW toward the Irminger Sea, but the role of this gateway in the evolution of ISOW properties over the subpolar gyre is unclear. A combination of ship-based and Deep-Argo data gathered between 2015 and 2018 allows us to investigate the pathways and hydrological evolution of ISOW as it flows through the BFZ, as well as its influence on the ISOW properties in the Irminger Sea. The ISOW flow through the BFZ amounts to 0.76 ± 0.2 Sv and is mainly fed by the lighter part of the ISOW layer flowing west of 29–30° W as part of the East Reykjanes Ridge Current in the Iceland Basin. In the rift valley of the BFZ, between an eastern and a western sill, the bathymetry of the BFZ shapes a cyclonic circulation along which the ISOW layer is homogenised. The largest changes in ISOW properties are however observed downstream of the western sill, at the exit of the BFZ. There, ISOW is mixed isopycnally with comparatively fresher ISOW from the Irminger Sea and lies over denser ISOW that entered the Irminger Sea south of the BFZ. These fresher ISOW result from the erosion of the ISOW core by mixing with inflows from the interior of the Irminger Sea as ISOW flows northward from the Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone. Hence, our analysis reveals the key role of the BFZ through-flow in compensating these inputs of fresh inflows along the northward Irminger Current.                         </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Compared with the reference MLDs calculated from individual profiles, MLDs calculated from monthly mean and gridded profiles show negative biases of 10-20 m in early spring related to the re-stratification process of relatively deep mixed layers. Vertical resolution of profiles also influences the MLD estimation. MLDs are underestimated by approximately 5-7 (14-16) m with the vertical resolution of 25 (50) m when the criterion of potential density exceeding the 10-m value by 0.03 kg m(-3) is used for the MLD estimation. Using the larger criterion (0.125 kg m(-3)) generally reduces the underestimations. In addition, positive biases greater than 100 m are found in wintertime subpolar regions when MLD criteria based on temperature are used. Biases of the reanalyses are due to both model errors and errors related to differences between the assimilation methods. The result shows that these errors are partially cancelled out through the ensemble averaging. Moreover, the bias in the ensemble mean field of the reanalyses is smaller than in the observation-only analyses. This is largely attributed to comparably higher resolutions of the reanalyses. The robust reproduction of both the seasonal cycle and interannual variability by the ensemble mean of the reanalyses indicates a great potential of the ensemble mean MLD field for investigating and monitoring upper ocean processes.'''\"}]}\n",

In spite of these expected changes in properties, the location where the salinity minimum outcrops does not change in any of the future scenarios. The stability of the outcrop location of the salinity minimum is linked to the relative stability of the position of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in UKESM1. The position of the ACC does not follow the maximum wind stress trend, which intensifies and shifts poleward under radiative forcing. Changes in surface buoyancy fluxes in the region are consistent with the changes in hydrographic properties observed at depth on the salinity minimum mentioned above. However, transformation rates at the density corresponding to the salinity minimum outcrop remain constant in all scenarios. Stability in transformation rates at that density is due to the haline and thermal contributions counteracting one another.

Tracer distributions (oxygen, salinity, and potential vorticity) show the presence of fronts extending from 500 to 3000 m and flanked by homogeneous regions. These structures define meridional staircase profiles that coincide with the alternating velocity profiles. Historical data confirm their presence in the off-equatorial deep tropical ocean with a zonal and temporal coherence throughout the basin.

With its large heat and carbon capacity and relatively slow dynamics, the ocean plays an integral role in climate, and provides an important source of predictability at seasonal and longer timescales. In addition, the ocean provides the slowly evolving lower boundary to the atmosphere, driving, and modifying atmospheric weather. Understanding and monitoring ocean climate variability and change, to constrain and initialize models as well as identify model biases for improved climate hindcasting and prediction, requires a scale-sensitive, and long-term observing system. A climate observing system has requirements that significantly differ from, and sometimes are orthogonal to, those of other applications. In general terms, they can be summarized by the simultaneous need for both large spatial and long temporal coverage, and by the accuracy and stability required for detecting the local climate signals. This paper reviews the requirements of a climate observing system in terms of space and time scales, and revisits the question of which parameters such a system should encompass to meet future strategic goals of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), with emphasis on ocean and sea-ice covered areas. It considers global as well as regional aspects that should be accounted for in designing observing systems in individual basins. Furthermore, the paper discusses which data-driven products are required to meet WCRP research and modeling needs, and ways to obtain them through data synthesis and assimilation approaches. Finally, it addresses the need for scientific capacity building and international collaboration in support of the collection of high-quality measurements over the large spatial scales and long time-scales required for climate research, bridging the scientific rational to the required resources for implementation.'''\"}]}\n",

Recent observations have shown that phytoplankton biomass increases in the North Atlantic during winter, even when the mixed layer is deepening and light is limited. Current theories suggest that this is due to a release from grazing pressure. Here we demonstrate that the often-used grazing models that are linear at low phytoplankton concentration do not allow for a wintertime increase in phytoplankton biomass. However, mathematical formulations of grazing as a function of phytoplankton concentration that are quadratic at low concentrations (or more generally decrease faster than linearly as phytoplankton concentration decreases) can reproduce the fall to spring transition in phytoplankton, including wintertime biomass accumulation. We illustrate this point with a minimal model for the annual cycle of North Atlantic phytoplankton designed to simulate phytoplankton concentration as observed by BioGeoChemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats in the North Atlantic.

However, the strength and statistical significance of this El Niño event have not been fully addressed, largely due to the lack of data. We take a closer look at the data using an ensemble analysis of the Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature version 5 (ERSSTv5). The ERSSTv5 standard run indicates a strong El Niño event with a peak monthly value of the Niño-3 index of 3.5°C during 1877/78, stronger than those during 1982/83, 1997/98, and 2015/16. However, an analysis of the ERSSTv5 ensemble runs indicates that the strength and significance (uncertainty estimates) depend on the construction of the ensembles. A 1000-member ensemble analysis shows that the ensemble mean Niño-3 index has a much weaker peak of 1.8°C, and its uncertainty is much larger during 1877/78 (2.8°C) than during 1982/83 (0.3°C), 1997/98 (0.2°C), and 2015/16 (0.1°C). Further, the large uncertainty during 1877/78 is associated with selections of a short (1 month) period of raw-data filter and a large (20%) acceptance criterion of empirical orthogonal teleconnection modes in the ERSSTv5 reconstruction. By adjusting these two parameters, the uncertainty during 1877/78 decreases to 0.5°C, while the peak monthly value of the Niño-3 index in the ensemble mean increases to 2.8°C, suggesting a strong and statistically significant 1877/78 El Niño event. The adjustment of those two parameters is validated by masking the modern observations of 1981–2017 to 1861–97. Based on the estimated uncertainties, the differences among the strength of these four major El Niño events are not statistically significant.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Detected eddies are then colocalized with in situ data from Argo floats to determine their vertical structure and the effect of eddies on the water masses. The numerous islands affect the eddy behavior as most eddies are formed in the lee of islands, propagate westward and decay when encountering shallow bathymetry. Eddies are sparse and short‐lived in the tropical area north of Fiji, impacting only the top 200 meters of water. They do not appear to be able to trap and transport waters in this region. In the Coral Sea, a region of lateral shear between currents transporting waters of different origins, eddies are more numerous and energetic. They affect the water properties down to at least 500 m depth, and anticyclonic eddies trap water to ∼200 m, contributing to the upper thermocline waters mixing and transport.

A classical approach to study these water masses is to track them on specific isopycnal levels. Nevertheless, their peaking thermohaline characteristics are not always found at a specific density but rather spread over a range. Here, we develop a detection algorithm able to capture the full vertical structure of the outflows, that we applied to a data set of about 126,000 vertical profiles. We are thus able to quantify the changes in their thermohaline signatures and in their vertical structures, characterized here by the intensity of the salinity peaks of the water masses and lateral injection of fresh and salty waters, and describe their spatial variability. Across the northwestern Indian Ocean, the salty outflows undergo several changes, diminishing their thermohaline signatures and peaks and layering.

Strong SSS fronts are found at the outer edge of this fresh pool. We investigate the seasonal dynamics of the fresh pool using complementary satellite wind, rain, sea level and in situ oceanic current data at the surface, along with hydrographic profiles. The fresh pool appears off Panama due to the strong summer rains associated with the northward migration of the ITCZ over Central America in June. During the second half of the year, the eastward‐flowing North Equatorial Counter‐Current keeps it trapped to the coast and strengthens the SSS front on its western edge. During winter, as the ITCZ moves southward, the northeasterly Panama gap wind creates a southwestward jet‐like current in its path with a dipole of Ekman pumping/eddies on its flanks.

To understand the mechanisms underlying such a trajectory, we study the evolution of an idealized surface eddy in a twolayer flat-bottom quasi-geostrophic model. The effect of several processes is studied, notably the presence of deep anticyclonic vorticity. This deep vorticity may result either from the tilting of the swoddy itself, or from the presence of an anticyclonic eddy of different origins, such as a meddy (Mediterranean Water EDDY). We also study the influence of a zonal coast south of the swoddy, via the \"mirror effect\". Firstly, a point-vortex model is used on the f-plane. When the surface and deep vortices lie much farther away from the coast than from each other, their motion is close to the addition of a mutually induced rotation and of a quasi-uniform zonal drift induced by the mirror vortices. The sensitivity of the rotation and translation characteristics to vortex position, strength, thickness and to a surrounding flow, are investigated. Such a surface-deep vortex interaction can reasonably well represent the observed motions of the swoddy, if the deep vortex is far enough from the surface one, and if they have comparable strengths. Then, a numerical code of the two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations is used to model finite-area vortices, again on the f-plane. Vertical alignment of the surface and deep vortices or vortex pairing with the mirror image, are not observed. Vortex splitting due to mutual shearing effects occurs only for vortices with very different strengths. Vortex trajectories similar to the ones observed are reproduced by the model for equal strength vortices. Complementary data, from the CONGAS experiments in 2004-2007, and from the ARGO profiling float database, are used to show that meddies (or at least coherent salinity anomalies at 1000 m depth) can originate from the continental slope near 45°N, 8°W and move regularly northeastward toward the region of swoddy generation and drift. These data also show that meddy-swoddy (\"deep vortex-surface vortex\") encounters may occur in the southeastern Bay of Biscay.\\'\\'\\''}]}\n",

Iceland–Scotland Overflow Water (ISOW) is exported from the Nordic Seas into the Iceland Basin to feed the lower limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation. The Bight Fracture Zone (BFZ) is known to be a major route for ISOW toward the Irminger Sea, but the role of this gateway in the evolution of ISOW properties over the subpolar gyre is unclear. A combination of ship-based and Deep-Argo data gathered between 2015 and 2018 allows us to investigate the pathways and hydrographic evolution of ISOW as it flows through the BFZ, as well as its influence on the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) properties in the Irminger Sea. The ISOW flow through the BFZ amounts to 0.8\\u2009±\\u20090.2\\u2009Sv and is mainly fed by the lighter part of the ISOW layer flowing west of 29–30∘\\u2009W as part of the East Reykjanes Ridge Current in the Iceland Basin. In the rift valley of the BFZ, between an eastern and a western sill, the bathymetry of the BFZ shapes a cyclonic circulation along which the ISOW layer is homogenized. The largest changes in ISOW properties are however observed downstream of the western sill, at the exit of the BFZ. There, ISOW is mixed isopycnally with comparatively fresher NADW circulating in the Irminger Sea. Hence, our analysis reveals the key role of the BFZ through-flow in the salinification of the NADW in the Irminger Current.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

A realistic 4D simulation has been used to track and quantify the MW routes and their property characteristics at the last region of subduction. It also allows us to quantify the water transformation after subduction. The simulation has been compared to available observations using a collocation method that interpolated model data onto observations in time and space. The comprehensive comparisons gave us confidence in the model's capacity to reproduce MW characteristics. A quantitative Lagrangian analysis was performed on the model output to depict the origin, the fate and the route of MW circulating in the southern Pacific Ocean, selected in the density range of 26.8-27.4 kg m−3. We found 18 Sv of MW were transported northward in patches through the 42° S section, mostly between 200 and 800 m depth. Of this transport, 8 Sv enters the Pacific Ocean in the upper layer south of Tasmania and subducts in the Pacific. The remainder is not ventilated in the Pacific sector: 4 Sv is advected from the Indian Ocean south of Tasmania at intermediate depth and finally 6 Sv is part of an intermediate depth recirculation within the Pacific Ocean. Particles take up to 30 years to travel northward through our domain before crossing the 42° S section. Southward transport branches also exist: 3 Sv flows southward following the eastern New Zealand coast and then exits through Drake Passage. An additional 4 Sv passes southward in the Tasman Sea, following the eastern Tasmanian coast and enters the Indian Ocean south of Tasmania, as part of the Tasman Leakage. Four different formation sites have been identified, where the MW are last ventilated. These formation sites have different water masses with specific salinity ranges. A study on the evolution of the physical characteristics of each of these water masses has been performed. All MW characteristics become more homogeneous at 42° S than they were when they left the mixed layer. This study confirms the homogenisation of mode waters at intermediate depth in the Pacific Ocean as previously revealed in the Indian Ocean using the same methodology. Transformations are shown to be mostly isopycnal in the Tasman Sea and diapycnal farther east.'''\"}]}\n",

The largest chlorophyll responses mostly occur within coastal regions, in contrast to the strongest cold wakes that generally occur farther offshore. To understand this decoupling, we analyze a coupled dynamical‐biogeochemical oceanic simulation forced by realistic wind vortices applied along observed TC tracks. The simulation displays a realistic spatial structure of TC‐induced blooms and its observed decoupling with TC cold wakes. In regions of strong TC energy input, the strongest cold wakes occur in regions of shallow thermocline (&lt;60\\u2009m) and the strongest blooms in regions of shallow nitracline and/or subsurface chlorophyll maximum (&lt;60\\u2009m). Shallow thermoclines are found over many open ocean regions, while regions of shallow nitracline and/or subsurface chlorophyll maximum are most prominent in near‐coastal areas, explaining the spatial decoupling between the cold and bloom wakes. The overall TC contribution to annual primary production is weak and amounts to ~1%, except in a few limited areas (east Eurasian coast, South tropical Indian Ocean, Northern Australian coast, and Eastern Pacific Ocean in the TC‐prone region) where it can locally reach up to 20–30%. Nearly 80% of this TC‐induced annual primary production is the result of the biogeochemical response to the 30% strongest TCs.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

These two products differ in their spatial resolution and in the use of an observational data assimilation scheme in the reanalysis. Both modeled solutions are compared at regional and local scale against several observational data sources. At regional scale, the forecast and reanalysis show realistic patterns in the area of study. However, at finer scales the results highlight better performances of the 1/36° forecast in coastal areas and the 1/12° reanalysis over open waters. The comparison emphasizes the possible benefits of the data assimilation scheme in areas away from the coastline, but also its limitations in complex coastal regions. Spatial resolution seems to play a key role in such areas, especially around the Iberian Peninsula, where the higher resolution forecast brings in general better results than the coarser resolution reanalysis.

A stronger South‐East Madagascar Current during La Niña may support a detachment of the current from the coasts, dampening the upwelling south of Madagascar, and feeding low‐salinity waters into the Madagascar Basin, hence increasing stratification.

Results show that the downscaling leads to an improvement of the time-averaged surface circulation, especially in the topographically complex area of the Balearic Sea. In particular, the path of the Balearic current is improved in the high-resolution model, also positively affecting transports through the Ibiza Channel. While the high-resolution model produces a similar number of large eddies as CMEMS Med Rea and altimetry, it generates a much larger number of small-scale eddies.

This negatively affects the representation of the variability of the surface currents interacting with these eddies, highlighting the importance of data assimilation in the high-resolution ocean model in this region to constrain the evolution of these mesoscale structures.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

A dynamically passive inert tracer was released in the interior South Pacific Ocean at latitudes of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Observational cross sections of the tracer were taken over 4 consecutive years as it drifted through Drake Passage and into the Atlantic Ocean. The tracer was released within a region of high salinity relative to surrounding waters at the same density. In the absence of irreversible mixing a tracer remains at constant salinity and temperature on an isopycnal surface. To investigate the process of irreversible mixing we analysed the tracer in potential density-versus-salinity-anomaly coordinates. Observations of high tracer concentration tended to be collocated with isopycnal salinity anomalies. With time, an initially narrow peak in tracer concentration as a function of salinity at constant density broadened with the tracer being found at ever fresher salinities, consistent with diffusion-like behaviour in that coordinate system. The second moment of the tracer as a function of salinity suggested an initial period of slow spreading for approximately 2\\xa0years in the Pacific, followed by more rapid spreading as the tracer entered Drake Passage and the Scotia Sea. Analysis of isopycnal salinity gradients based on the Argo programme suggests that part of this apparent change can be explained by changes in background salinity gradients while part may be explained by the evolution of the tracer patch from a slowly growing phase where the tracer forms filaments to a more rapid phase where the tracer mixes at 240–550\\u2009m2\\u2009s−1.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

This study aims to investigate the main sources of the natural variability in the <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> fluorescence signal in the global open ocean, specifically the influence of the phytoplankton community composition. In this view, we analyzed a combination of three datasets comprising concomitant measurements of <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> fluorescence, pigment concentrations and phytoplankton absorption spectra. Two datasets cover several contrasted bioregions of the global ocean whereas the third one consists of a regional time series in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, which allows to examine the effect of phytoplankton community composition on the fluorescence signal on the global, seasonal and vertical scales. We studied the variability of the two major drivers of the natural variability of the fluorescence process, i.e. the light absorption and the fluorescence quantum yield of phytoplankton, in regards of the variability of the pigment composition of the communities. The community composition correlates substantially with the Chla-to-fluorescence ratio, with high fluorescence values associated with phytoplankton communities dominated by large cells. This trend may be explained by the combined effects of the community composition on the phytoplankton absorption coefficient and the fluorescence quantum yield, and is consistently observed globally, seasonally and vertically. Non-photosynthetic pigments also appear to play a critical role in oligotrophic surface waters, leading to a reduction of the quantum yield of fluorescence. The results indicate that the phytoplankton community composition plays a key role in the relationship between the <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> fluorescence signal and Chla concentration. Therefore, we suggest that taking into account the composition of phytoplankton communities in the retrieval of the Chla concentration from current <jats:italic>in-situ</jats:italic> fluorometers, those mounted on BGC-Argo floats in particular, would lead to a better estimation of the phytoplankton biomass on a wide range of spatial and temporal scales.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Using more than 5 years of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) and complementary satellite wind, rain, currents, and sea surface temperature data together with a historical ensemble of in situ products, the present study explores the seasonal and interannual dynamics of the fresh pool over the period 2004–2015. An important interannual variability of the maximal surface extension of the EPFP over the past decade is revealed with two extreme events (2012, 2015) occurring during the SMOS satellite period. These extremes are found to be related to the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases and associated anomalies of precipitation, surface currents, and trade wind in the central Pacific. In 2012 (La Niña), stronger trade winds coupled with a deficit of precipitation induced a minimum extension of the pool during the rainy season. Whereas, during the strong El Niño 2014–2015, the EPFP extension reached an unprecedented maximum value.

The Deep Chlorophyll Maximum (DCM) is a well known feature of the global ocean. However, its description and the study of its formation are a challenge, especially in the peculiar Black Sea environment. The retrieval of Chlorophyll a (Chla) from fluorescence (Fluo) profiles recorded by Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats is not trivial in the Black Sea, due to the very high content of Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) which contributes to the fluorescence signal and produces an apparent increase of the Chla concentration with depth.  Here we revised Fluo correction protocols for the Black Sea context using co-located in-situ High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and BGC-Argo measurements. The processed set of Argo Chla data (2014–2019) is then used to provide a systematic description of the seasonal DCM dynamics in the Black Sea, and to explore different hypotheses concerning the mechanisms underlying its development.  Our results show that the corrections applied to Chla profiles are consistent with HPLC data. In the Black Sea, the DCM is initiated in March, throughout the basin, at a pycnal level set by the previous winter mixed layer. The DCM then remains attached to this particular layer until the end of September. The spatial homogeneity of this feature suggests a self-sustaining DCM structure, locally influencing environmental conditions rather than adapting instantaneously to external factors.

The unique lens‐shaped signatures that ITEs leave on temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen vertical distributions are used as proxies to assess their influences on vertical OMZ boundaries and thickness. Data from in situ profiles in the region (World Ocean Database and Argo databases) are used in correlation analyses between anomalous depths (and vertical displacements) of oxyclines and isopycnals/isotherms, together with an objective eddy detection method based on satellite altimetry to identify the location of such profiles (i.e., outside or inside cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies).

In operational systems, biogeochemical (BGC) models are forced - or coupled - with physical ocean models fields that are generally constrained by data assimilation of temperature, salinity and sea level anomalies. Yet, while physical data assimilation substantially improves simulated physical fields, BGC models forced by such analyses are commonly degraded, and more especially in equatorial regions. Here impacts of physical data assimilation on surface chlorophyll and nitrate concentrations are investigated in the tropical Pacific, based on three ocean reanalysis runs using the same physical-BGC model configuration but differing in their level of physical data assimilation. It is shown that, in the Mercator Ocean operational system, the assimilation of satellite altimetry and sea surface temperature in addition to temperature and salinity in situ profiles leads to spurious vertical velocities in the western equatorial Pacific. Our analysis suggests that these unrealistic vertical velocities are explained by the use of an inaccurate mean dynamic topography for the assimilation of altimetry that modifies the pressure-driven horizontal circulation in the upper ocean layer. Moreover, the biases found in this key region modify the subtle dynamical and BGC balances in the whole tropical Pacific and result in unrealistic trends of ocean heat content and nitrate concentration. This study demonstrates that looking into details of the physics is indispensable to improve physical data assimilation systems and to ensure that they make the best use of observations. This is also a key point to refine the strategy of the BGC models forcing and further improve ocean predictions.'''\"}]}\n",

Despite the ever-growing number of ocean data, the interior of the ocean remains undersampled in regions of high variability such as the Gulf Stream. In this context, neural networks have been shown to be effective for interpolating properties and understanding ocean processes. We introduce OSnet (Ocean Stratification network), a new ocean reconstruction system aimed at providing a physically consistent analysis of the upper ocean stratification. The proposed scheme is a bootstrapped multilayer perceptron trained to predict simultaneously temperature and salinity (T−S) profiles down to 1000\\u2009m and the mixed-layer depth (MLD) from surface data covering 1993 to 2019. OSnet is trained to fit sea surface temperature and sea level anomalies onto all historical in situ profiles in the Gulf Stream region. To achieve vertical coherence of the profiles, the MLD prediction is used to adjust a posteriori the vertical gradients of predicted T−S profiles, thus increasing the accuracy of the solution and removing vertical density inversions. The prediction is generalized on a 1/4∘ daily grid, producing four-dimensional fields of temperature and salinity, with their associated confidence interval issued from the bootstrap. OSnet profiles have root mean square error comparable with the observation-based Armor3D weekly product and the physics-based ocean reanalysis Glorys12. The lowest confidence in the prediction is located north of the Gulf Stream, between the shelf and the current, where the thermohaline variability is large. The OSnet reconstructed field is coherent even in the pre-Argo years, demonstrating the good generalization properties of the network. It reproduces the warming trend of surface temperature, the seasonal cycle of surface salinity and mesoscale structures of temperature, salinity and MLD. While OSnet delivers an accurate interpolation of the ocean stratification, it is also a tool to study how the ocean stratification relates to surface data. We can compute the relative importance of each input for each T−S prediction and analyse how the network learns which surface feature influences most which property and at which depth. Our results demonstrate the potential of machine learning methods to improve predictions of ocean interior properties from observations of the ocean surface.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Calibration and validation of these measurements is challenging because satellite and in situ methods measure salinity differently. Microwave radiometers measure the salinity in the top few centimeters of the ocean, whereas most in situ observations are reported below a depth of a few meters. Additionally, satellites measure salinity as a spatial average over an area of about 100 × 100 km2. In contrast, in situ sensors provide pointwise measurements at the location of the sensor. Thus, the presence of vertical gradients in, and horizontal variability of, sea surface salinity complicates comparison of satellite and in situ measurements. This paper synthesizes present knowledge of the magnitude and the processes that contribute to the formation and evolution of vertical and horizontal variability in near-surface salinity. Rainfall, freshwater plumes, and evaporation can generate vertical gradients of salinity, and in some cases these gradients can be large enough to affect validation of satellite measurements. Similarly, mesoscale to submesoscale processes can lead to horizontal variability that can also affect comparisons of satellite data to in situ data.

By using recent in situ data and climatological outputs from a numerical simulation, we reveal the existence of a barrier layer in the NEGG and describe its seasonal occurrence. In the NEGG, the barrier layer limits the mixed layer depth. From January to March, significant values for the barrier-layer thickness are observed mostly due to the horizontal advection of fresh water. From April, vertical mixing along with vertical advection increase the sea surface salinity; hence, the barrier-layer thickness decreases and reaches its minimum in July. During the rest of the year, values for the barrier-layer thickness are again high, mostly under the influence of the Niger River discharge and precipitation, with the highest values recorded in October, when the river discharge and precipitation are at a maximum.Keywords: mixed layer depth, Niger River discharge, numerical model, oceanography, sea surface salinity, tropical Atlantic, vertical stratification'''\"}]}\n",

Outside of an equatorial band, the total transports are the sum of the vertical integrals of geostrophic- and wind-driven Ekman currents. However, these transports are generally divergent, and to obtain a mass conserving circulation, a Poisson equation is solved for the streamfunction with Dirichlet boundary conditions at solid boundaries. The value of the streamfunction on islands is also part of the unknowns. This study presents and discusses an energetic circulation in three basins: the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, and the Southern Ocean.

The study focuses particularly on the role of barotropic Rossby waves as a first step toward understanding the relevant physical mechanisms. It is shown from a set of idealized numerical simulations and analytical solutions that nonlinear triad interactions (NLTIs) play a crucial role in the transfer of energy toward jet-like structures (long waves with short meridional wavelengths) that induce a zonal residual mean circulation.

Data were separated into several categories: shallow and deep XBTs and below or above 10°C of vertically averaged ocean temperatures (in the top 400 m). Also, XBT measurements in the western Pacific between 1968 and 1985 were processed separately because of large regional biases. The estimated corrections deviate from other published estimates with some large variations in time of both linear and curvature terms in the depth corrections, and less time variation of the temperature correction for the deep XBTs. This analysis of heat content derived from corrected XBTs provides at first order a similar variability to other estimates from corrected XBTs and mechanical bathythermographs (MBTs).

These alternating jets, with mean speeds about 5 cm s−1, are clearly present in the western and central parts of the basin but weaken and disappear approaching the eastern coast.

The jets closer to the equator are remarkably zonally coherent across the basin, but the jets farther poleward appear broken in several segments. In the western half of the basin, the 1000-m zonal jets appear to slant slightly poleward from east to west. At the western boundary in the south (east of Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea), the alternating jets appear to connect in narrow boundary currents.

Observing System Experiment (OSE) studies illustrate the impacts of the severe decrease in the number of TAO buoys during 2012-2014 and TRITON buoys since 2013 on ODAP system performance. Multi-system evaluation of the impacts of assimilating satellite sea surface salinity data based on OSEs has been performed to demonstrate the need to continue and enhance satellite salinity missions. Impacts of underwater gliders have been assessed using Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to provide guidance on the effective coordination of the western North Atlantic observing system elements. OSSEs are also being performed under H2020 AtlantOS project with the goal to enhance and optimize the Atlanticin-situnetworks. Potential offuture satellite missions of wide-swath altimetry and surface ocean currents monitoring isexplored through OSSEs and evaluation of Degrees of Freedomfor Signal (DFS). ForecastSensitivity Observation Impacts (FSOI) are routinely evaluated for monitoring the oceanobservation impacts in the US Navy’s ODAP system. Perspectives on the extension ofOS-Eval to coastal regions, the deep ocean, polar regions, coupled data assimilation,and biogeochemical applications are also presented. Basedon the examples above,we identify the limitations of OS-Eval, indicating that themost significant limitation isreduction of robustness and reliability of the results due to their system-dependency.The difficulty of performing evaluation in near real time is also critical. A strategy tomitigate the limitation and to strengthen the impact of evaluations is discussed. Inparticular, we emphasize the importance of collaboration within the ODAP community formulti-system evaluation and of communication with ocean observational communitieson the design of OS-Eval, required resources, and effectivedistribution of the results.Finally, we recommend further developing OS-Eval activities at international level withthe support of the international ODAP (e.g., OceanPredict and CLIVAR-GSOP) andobservational communities.'''\"}]}\n",

After decades of advancement in ocean observing technologies, one of the key remaining challenges is how to cost-effectively make measurements at the increased resolution necessary for illuminating complex system processes and rapidly evolving changes. In recent years, biogeochemical in situ sensors have been emerging that are threefold or more lower in cost than established technologies; the cost reduction for many biological in situ sensors has also been significant, although the absolute costs are still relatively high. Cost savings in these advancements has been driven by miniaturization, new methods of packaging, and lower-cost massproduced components such as electronics and materials. Recently, field projects have demonstrated the potential for science-quality data collection via large-scale deployments using cost-effective sensors and deployment strategies. In the coming decade, it is envisioned that ocean biogeochemistry and biology observations will be revolutionized by continued innovation in sensors with increasingly low price points and the scale-up of deployments of these in situ sensor technologies. The goal of this study is therefore to: (1) provide a review of existing sensor technologies that are already achieving cost-effectiveness compared with traditional instrumentation, (2) present case studies of cost-effective in situ deployments that can provide insight into methods for bridging observational gaps, (3) identify key challenge areas where progress in cost reduction is lagging, and (4) present a number of potentially transformative directions for future ocean biogeochemical and biological studies using cost-effective technologies and deployment strategies.'''\"}]}\n",

Until now, basin-scale ocean observation has been conducted through loosely-aligned arrangements of national and international efforts. The All-Atlantic Ocean Observing System (AtlantOS) is an integrated concept for a forward-looking framework and basin-scale partnership to establish a comprehensive ocean observing system for the Atlantic Ocean as a whole. The system will be sustainable, multi-disciplinary, multi-thematic, efficient, and fit-for-purpose. Platforms, networks, and systems do already exist that operate at various maturity levels. AtlantOS will go beyond the status quo by bringing together the observing communities and countries of the Atlantic basin, providing the opportunity to join and support the system. AtlantOS will build upon the coordinated work of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) and the Group on Earth Observations (GEO), two international bodies that support and coordinate global ocean observing. AtlantOS will complement those efforts and offers a new approach to organizing ocean observing at the basin-scale.

GOOS now also encompasses operational services and marine ecosystem health, from the open ocean into coastal environments where much of the world’s population resides. This has opened a field of opportunity for new collaborations—across regions, communities, and technologies—facilitating enhanced engagement in the global ocean observing enterprise to benefit all nations. Enhancement of collaboration is considered from the perspectives of regional alliances, global networks, national systems, in situ observing, remote sensing, oceanography, and meteorology. Reinvigoration of GOOS Regional Alliances has been important in connecting the power of this expanded remit to the needs of coastal populations and the capabilities of regional and national marine science communities. An assessment of progress is provided, including issues/challenges with the current structure, and opportunities to increase participation and impact. Meeting the expanded requirements of GOOS will entail new system networks. The Joint Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology Observations Coordination Group has been working with some communities to help assess their readiness, including high frequency radars, ocean gliders, and animal tracking. Much more needs to be done, with a range of strategies considered. Other opportunities include partnering with programs such as the Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network, engaging with mature and emerging national ocean observing programs, and learning from multinational projects such as Tropical Pacific Observing System 2020 and AtlantOS, which are bringing renewed rigor to the design and operation of regional observing systems. Consideration is given to the expansion and advancement that is coming in both in situ and remote sensing ocean observation platforms over the next decade. In combination they provide the potential to measure new Essential Ocean Variables routinely at global scale. Opportunities provided by the World Meteorological Organization Integrated Global Observing System (WIGOS) in fostering a comprehensive and integrated approach across meteorology and oceanography are also considered. The focus of WIGOS on providing accurate, reliable and timely weather, climate, and related environmental observations and products sits well with the expanded requirements of GOOS, in climate, operational services, and marine ecosystem health.'''\"}]}\n",

This deliverable provides a complete report on the collaborative framework strategy and its implementation. The toolkit is organised around “repositories”: a collection of files (possibly) with online collaborative services like discussion threads (“Issues”), wiki pages, project management boards and a complete set of community development tools (based on “git”). The content of each repository can be shared through web sites or published with packages (eg “npm”, “docker”, etc ...) or a simple zip file release. The Euro-Argo partners have agreed to use this toolkit as the primary tool to share, distribute and work together on Argo community tools. This has been started during this first year.

The succession of strong mistral and tramontane situations, leading to significant evaporation and ocean heat loss, is well known as the controlling factor in the dense water formation (DWF) with deep convection episodes. During HyMeX‐SOP2 (1 February to 15 March 2013), several platforms sampled the area in order to document DWF and air‐sea exchanges. This study investigates the ability of the NEMO‐WMED36 ocean model (1/36°‐resolution), driven in surface by the hourly air‐sea fluxes from the AROME‐WMED forecasts (2.5 km resolution), to represent DWF during HyMeX‐SOP2 and focuses on the sensitivity to initial conditions. After a short evaluation of the atmospheric forcing, the high‐resolution oceanic simulations using three different data sets as initial and boundary conditions are compared to observations collected during the field campaign. It evidences that using regional model outputs may lead to unrealistic thermohaline characteristics for the intermediate and deep waters, which degrade the simulated new dense water formed. Using ocean analyses built from observations, permits to obtain more realistic characteristics of the Western Mediterranean dense water. However, a low stratification favors an overestimation of the convective area and of the DWF rate. The DWF chronology is also impacted.

The Polar Front appears as a natural boundary between the two regions, where steric height variations are minimized.

Two different data sets of diffuse attenuation coefficients (𝐾d) for downward planar irradiance were used in MedBFM to carry out three 15-year simulations. The first simulation is based on climatological values retrieved with a global algorithm; the second uses an updated, interannually variable product from 4 different sensors, obtained with a regional algorithm specifically developed for the Mediterranean Sea; the third is forced by a climatological data set extracted from the updated algorithm. Differences between the two Kd data sets are evaluated in terms of the adopted/differing remote sensing algorithms, and the impact of the two different optical forcings on the MedBFM model output is quantified, with a specific focus on chlorophyll, also distinguishing the effect of using the interannually variable 𝐾d by the one related to the algorithm upgrade.

(2007). Data coverage is heterogeneous, with increased density in 2002 when Argo floats become available, high density along Voluntary Observing Ship lines, and low density south of 10°S. Using lag correlation, the seasonal reemergence of SSS anomalies is investigated between 20°N and 50°N in 5°x5° boxes during the 1993-2016 period, both locally and remotely following the displacements of the deep mixed-layer waters estimated from virtual float trajectories derived from the daily AVISO surface geostrophic currents. Although SSS data are noisy, local SSS reemergence is detected in about half of the boxes, notably in the northeast and southeast, while little reemergence is seen in the central and part of the eastern subtropical gyre. In the same period, sea surface temperature (SST) reemergence is found only slightly more frequently, reflecting the short data duration. However, taking geostrophic advection into account degrades the detection of remote SSS and even SST reemergence. When anomalies are averaged over broader areas, robust evidence of a second and third SSS reemergence peak is found in the northeastern and southeastern parts of the domain, indicating long cold-season persistence of large-scale SSS anomalies, while only a first SST reemergence is seen. An oceanic reanalysis is used to confirm that the correlation analysis indeed reflects the reemergence of subsurface salinity anomalies.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

In the north-western Mediterranean, the strong, dry, cold winds, the Tramontane and Mistral, produce intense heat and moisture exchange at the interface between the ocean and the atmosphere leading to the formation of deep dense waters, a process that occurs only in certain regions of the world. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the ability of a new coupled ocean–atmosphere modelling system based on MESONH-SURFEX-SYMPHONIE to simulate a deep-water formation event in real conditions. The study focuses on summer 2012 to spring 2013, a favourable period that is well documented by previous studies and for which many observations are available. Model results are assessed through detailed comparisons with different observation data sets, including measurements from buoys, moorings and floats. The good overall agreement between observations and model results shows that the new coupled system satisfactorily simulates the formation of deep dense water and can be used with confidence to study ocean–atmosphere coupling in the north-western Mediterranean. In addition, to evaluate the uncertainty associated with the representation of turbulent fluxes in strong wind conditions, several simulations were carried out based on different parameterizations of the flux bulk formulas. The results point out that the choice of turbulent flux parameterization strongly influences the simulation of the deep-water convection and can modify the volume of the newly formed deep water by a factor of\\xa02.                     </jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

The sea surface salinity (SSS) measured from space by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has recently been revisited by the European Space Agency first campaign reprocessing. We show that, with respect to the previous version, biases close to land and ice greatly decrease. The accuracy of SMOS SSS averaged over 10 days, 100 × 100 km2 in the open ocean and estimated by comparison to ARGO (Array for Real-Time Geostrophic Oceanography) SSS is on the order of 0.3–0.4 in tropical and subtropical regions and 0.5 in a cold region. The averaged negative SSS bias (−0.1) observed in the tropical Pacific Ocean between 5° N and 15° N, relatively to other regions, is suppressed when SMOS observations concomitant with rain events, as detected from SSM/Is (Special Sensor Microwave Imager) rain rates, are removed from the SMOS–ARGO comparisons. The SMOS freshening is linearly correlated to SSM/Is rain rate with a slope estimated to −0.14 mm−1 h, after correction for rain atmospheric contribution. This tendency is the signature of the temporal SSS variability between the time of SMOS and ARGO measurements linked to rain variability and of the vertical salinity stratification between the first centimeter of the sea surface layer sampled by SMOS and the 5 m depth sampled by ARGO. However, given that the whole set of collocations includes situations with ARGO measurements concomitant with rain events collocated with SMOS measurements under no rain, the mean −0.1 bias and the negative skewness of the statistical distribution of SMOS minus ARGO SSS difference are very likely the mean signature of the vertical salinity stratification. In the future, the analysis of ongoing in situ salinity measurements in the top 50 cm of the sea surface and of Aquarius satellite SSS are expected to provide complementary information about the sea surface salinity stratification.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

The tropical Atlantic also connects the southern and northern branches of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and receives freshwater input from some of the world’s largest rivers. To address these diverse, unique, and interconnected research challenges, a rich network of ocean observations has developed, building on the backbone of the Prediction and Research Moored Array in the Tropical Atlantic (PIRATA). This network has evolved naturally over time and out of necessity in order to address the most important outstanding scientific questions and to improve predictions of tropical Atlantic severe weather and global climate variability and change. The tropical Atlantic observing system is motivated by goals to understand and better predict phenomena such as tropical Atlantic interannual to decadal variability and climate change; multidecadal variability and its links to the meridional overturning circulation; air-sea fluxes of CO2 and their implications for the fate of anthropogenic CO2; the Amazon River plume and its interactions with biogeochemistry, vertical mixing, and hurricanes; the highly productive eastern boundary and equatorial upwelling systems; and oceanic oxygen minimum zones, their impacts on biogeochemical cycles and marine ecosystems, and their feedbacks to climate. Past success of the tropical Atlantic observing system is the result of an international commitment to sustained observations and scientific cooperation, a willingness to evolve with changing research and monitoring needs, and a desire to share data openly with the scientific community and operational centers. The observing system must continue to evolve in order to meet an expanding set of research priorities and operational challenges. This paper discusses the tropical Atlantic observing system, including emerging scientific questions that demand sustained ocean observations, the potential for further integration of the observing system, and the requirements for sustaining and enhancing the tropical Atlantic observing system'''\"}]}\n",

The Red Sea provides 90% of the Kingdom’s potable water by desalinization, supporting tourism, shipping, aquaculture, and fishing industries, which together contribute about 10%–20% of the country’s GDP. All these activities, and those elsewhere in the Red Sea region, critically depend on oceanic and atmospheric conditions. At a time of mega-development projects along the Red Sea coast, and global warming, authorities are working on optimizing the harnessing of environmental resources, including renewable energy and rainwater harvesting. All these require high-resolution weather and climate information. Toward this end, we have undertaken a multipronged research and development activity in which we are developing an integrated data-driven regional coupled modeling system. The telescopically nested components include 5-km- to 600-m-resolution atmospheric models to address weather and climate challenges, 4-km- to 50-m-resolution ocean models with regional and coastal configurations to simulate and predict the general and mesoscale circulation, 4-km- to 100-m-resolution ecosystem models to simulate the biogeochemistry, and 1-km- to 50-m-resolution wave models. In addition, a complementary probabilistic transport modeling system predicts dispersion of contaminant plumes, oil spill, and marine ecosystem connectivity. Advanced ensemble data assimilation capabilities have also been implemented for accurate forecasting. Resulting achievements include significant advancement in our understanding of the regional circulation and its connection to the global climate, development, and validation of long-term Red Sea regional atmospheric–oceanic–wave reanalyses and forecasting capacities. These products are being extensively used by academia, government, and industry in various weather and marine studies and operations, environmental policies, renewable energy applications, impact assessment, flood forecasting, and more.</jats:p>'''\"}]}\n",

Satellite sea surface salinity (SSS) data obtained using Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission indicate steady salinification of the eastern Mediterranean Levantine Basin at a rate of ~0.14 psu/year during 2015–2018. Satellite-observed salinity changes are confirmed by Argo float data and suggest possible changes in properties of the Levantine Intermediate Water. Eastern Mediterranean salinification often coincides with a freshening of the western Ionian Sea. Based on satellite altimetry geostrophic currents, these salinity changes are concurrent with a weakening cyclonic circulation in the Levantine Basin and strengthening anticyclonic circulation in the Ionian Sea. The latter is indicative of the Adriatic-Ionian Bimodal Oscillation System. It is known that such circulation changes reduce (increase) the transport of fresh Modified Atlantic Water into the eastern Mediterranean (western Ionian Sea), and this is consistent with observed SSS changes. The quality and availability of satellite L-band (1.41 GHz) SSS estimates near the coast can be limited by land contamination. It is shown that absolute SSS retrievals exhibit up to 1\\u202fpsu biases in the Mediterranean. This study&#039;s use of SMAP SSS anomaly mapping instead of absolute SSS illustrates that observed spatial/temporal SSS patterns allow investigation of time variable change in this basin and augment the existing regional observing system.'''\"}]}\n"
